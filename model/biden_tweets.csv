10.9.2020 21.33	JoeBiden	MarkCavitt	2264	9365	26094	Donald Trump is holding a rally in Michigan today—while also refusing to fully fund their National Guard. These are frontline workers against COVID-19, responsible for testing and distributing food and medical supplies. Michiganders need a pandemic response—not a pep rally.				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1304171037240619008

12.8.2020 21.25	JoeBiden		9191	15058	125934	One of the reasons I chose @KamalaHarris is because we both believe you can define America in one simple word — possibilities.		@KamalaHarris		1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1293659775796776961

12.8.2020 21.14	JoeBiden		2566	5494	32778	Working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don’t have anyone on their side with this president. That’s going to change in the Biden-Harris administration.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1293657007522811912	
12.8.2020 21.05	JoeBiden		20378	24542	203049	This morning, little girls woke up across this nation — especially Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — potentially seeing themselves in a new way: As the stuff of Presidents and Vice Presidents.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1293654742820777984

11.8.2020 20.17	JoeBiden		7838	34201	235746	Back when Kamala was Attorney General, she worked closely with Beau. I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse. I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1293280412144267264

It's heartless. I'll protect and build on the ACA to ensure everyone gets the care they need.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1293215600680951810	
11.8.2020 13.20	JoeBiden		27316	41676	307456	I promise you if I'm elected, I won't waste any time getting this virus under control. I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on.

11.8.2020 2.31	JoeBiden	austinramzy	5067	7380	31092	This is the latest dire consequence of Donald Trump looking the other way on Beijing's repression in Hong Kong.

11.8.2020 0.40	JoeBiden		6150	17504	82638	Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement — giving countless Americans peace of mind and the ability to retire with dignity.

10.8.2020 21.00	JoeBiden		1121	5724	15810	Bristol Bay is no place for a mine — our administration decided that in 2014. We're only discussing it today because Donald Trump's EPA reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's CEO.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1292928711243771911	
10.8.2020 20.43	JoeBiden		36148	34985	169276	Donald Trump said that if he’s re-elected, he’ll defund Social Security. We can't let that happen.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1292924430272921606

10.8.2020 17.10	JoeBiden		2680	7309	24119	Donald Trump’s surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of Americans. After six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through. But I do:				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1292870827168342017

9.8.2020 21.30	JoeBiden		11846	21134	115002	Every single eligible American should have the opportunity to vote-by-mail this November. If it's good enough for Donald Trump — then it's good enough for you and me.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1292573870281629697	
9.8.2020 19.15	JoeBiden		21631	42980	270377	We can’t let Donald Trump destroy the U.S. Postal Service.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1292539896465416192	
9.8.2020 17.00	JoeBiden		20836	11747	70816	It's been six years since Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson — reigniting a movement. We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1292505925685633025	
9.8.2020 15.00	JoeBiden		26599	31365	202292	Our planet can’t take four more years of Donald Trump. We have to get him out of the White House so we can start treating the climate crisis like the urgent threat it is.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1292475731172261894	
9.8.2020 13.00	JoeBiden		5254	13750	57615	Giving the Trump administration another four years in office would have catastrophic implications for future generations.

9.8.2020 1.00	JoeBiden		8560	20240	96882	The United States just passed 5 million reported infections of COVID-19. It’s a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. Each time the number goes up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. It shouldn’t have gotten this bad.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1292264334287044609	
9.8.2020 0.30	JoeBiden		4004	18037	46042	Today, Donald Trump stated that if re-elected, he'll undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security.

9.8.2020 0.00	JoeBiden		3470	22116	58087	Donald Trump has refused to take serious action to combat the COVID-19 crisis. And as a result, he got what he’s always wanted — the U.S. isolated from the rest of the world.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1292249233316130816

8.8.2020 19.00	JoeBiden		4096	14845	44252	The fact is, Donald Trump left our nation unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health crisis of our lifetime — and we're paying the price every single day.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1292173738910216192	
8.8.2020 16.45	JoeBiden		8668	11894	64526	Our nation is desperate for leadership — leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises.

7.8.2020 22.53	JoeBiden		6791	18617	100738	I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd.

7.8.2020 19.22	JoeBiden		3213	6477	21669	Here’s the truth—Donald Trump turned his back on the middle class long before COVID-19. He cut taxes for the super-wealthy, drove U.S. manufacturing into a recession, and stacked the deck against hardworking Americans. It's time we pick a different path.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1291816882434121728

7.8.2020 11.01	JoeBiden		1492	6572	27779	The truth is that President Trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic—it's obvious he still hasn’t learned his lesson. He continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1291690890566737920	
7.8.2020 11.01	JoeBiden		878	5076	22104	Here’s how COVID-19 affected Arizonans under the Trump—Ducey model: - An infection rate—still—of nearly 20% - The fifth-highest number of current hospitalizations in the country - More than 4,000 deaths from COVID-19 - More than 183,000 cases - Lengthy delays in test results				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1291690889874743296	
7.8.2020 11.01	JoeBiden		368	3538	17203	Gov. Ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing. He’s withholding support for increased testing and making local leaders plead for it. He’s refusing to implement a mask mandate and turning his back on older Americans and those at greater risk.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1291690889174228992	
7.8.2020 11.01	JoeBiden		3577	11914	45960	President Trump called Arizona “a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.” He said Governor Ducey’s approach should be used by other states—but here’s what’s really happening in Arizona:				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1291690888477970432

7.8.2020 1.03	JoeBiden		37908	12446	85801	Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify.

6.8.2020 18.45	JoeBiden		2002	5863	18096	The fight for civil rights is what drove me to get involved in politics in the first place.

5.8.2020 22.30	JoeBiden		2113	2588	10500	I don’t buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past.

5.8.2020 19.15	JoeBiden		14741	10036	51025	Weapons of war have no place in our communities.

5.8.2020 18.15	JoeBiden		2893	11608	60766	Eight years ago, a white supremacist targeted a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, WI — ultimately taking seven lives in an unspeakable act of terror. To truly honor those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbor, and reduce gun violence.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1291075245751832576

5.8.2020 13.10	JoeBiden		8402	38578	128450	The truth of the matter is, Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he inherited in his life, he squandered it.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1290998489975885826	
5.8.2020 0.50	JoeBiden		8842	17227	81334	From day one, Donald Trump downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, ignored scientists, and refused to take action.

4.8.2020 15.25	JoeBiden		1524	4450	30464	As president, I’ll take on the powerful gun lobby to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and close loopholes to keep guns out of dangerous hands.

4.8.2020 15.25	JoeBiden		1258	8073	38860	One year ago, just hours after the massacre in El Paso, nine precious lives were cut short in Dayton. In the wake of the tragedies, Donald Trump promised the most modest of gun safety policies, then caved to the @NRA and failed to deliver.		@NRA		1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1290670186794815491	
4.8.2020 11.30	JoeBiden		5394	13683	70303	On July 1st, Donald Trump predicted the coronavirus was going to "just disappear." He was wrong — and more than 25,000 Americans died due to the virus last month. Mr. President, step up and do your job before even more American families feel the pain of losing a loved one.				1,29E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1290610936022171655

3.8.2020 17.22	JoeBiden		2326	7789	37860	This is a moment to summon the purpose we felt one year ago after El Paso. A moment to recommit to the battle for the soul of this nation.

3.8.2020 15.42	JoeBiden		2010	8859	33008	One year ago, a white supremacist armed with a semi-automatic rifle targeted the people of El Paso.

22.6.2020 16.52	JoeBiden		26080	37047	224662	We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation. We can't stand by and let that happen.				1,28E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1275109292014620672

22.6.2020 3.40	JoeBiden	axios	7649	7674	37550	Trump talks tough on Venezuela, but admires thugs and dictators like Nicolas Maduro. As President, I will stand with the Venezuelan people and for democracy.				1,27E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1274910217508196352	
22.6.2020 2.59	JoeBiden	axios	2412	8504	33488	Trump opposed sanctioning China’s government over its atrocious human rights violations to protect his hollow trade deal and serve his own personal interests.

21.6.2020 23.42	JoeBiden		3122	11225	90928	My dad instilled a lot in me, but perhaps most important is the belief that there’s no higher calling than to be a good parent.

21.6.2020 19.24	JoeBiden		3418	15403	46922	It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress. If we stand together, as one America, we'll rise stronger than before.				1,27E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1274785156050464768

Countless others did the hard work and paid a price just for being themselves. Christian Cooper and I discussed the trailblazers who came before us and the work that remains:				1,27E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1274467563745865729	
20.6.2020 21.24	JoeBiden		24069	30916	185314	Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable. Unbelievable.				1,27E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1274452967211569155	
20.6.2020 19.36	JoeBiden		2192	11792	32794	The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history — and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long.

19.6.2020 23.05	JoeBiden		6586	24328	129810	Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives — and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.				1,27E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1274115997029421056	
19.6.2020 20.47	JoeBiden		2359	10993	33524	I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important — who we want to be. It’s all at stake. That's the case we're making in our first TV ad of the general election:				1,27E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1274081268142137350

18.6.2020 22.12	JoeBiden		1123	4627	18252	Just like Donald Trump couldn’t wish COVID-19 away in March, and just like he couldn’t tweet it away in April — he can’t ignore it away in June.				1,27E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1273740271214227456

18.6.2020 19.37	JoeBiden	NPR	1689	6308	25956	It didn’t have to be this bad. But we have a president who is more interested in taking a victory lap than he is in doing the work needed to solve this crisis. We need a president who will put the American people first — and actually do the work.				1,27E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1273701510380126212	
18.6.2020 18.06	JoeBiden	BarackObama	1641	11974	71781	Thanks, Barack. You're right — and we won't stop until every Dreamer feels safe in this country.				1,27E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1273678505901948928	
18.6.2020 17.35	JoeBiden		5666	14924	51825	Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he has inherited in his life, he has squandered it.				1,27E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1273670561864929280	
18.6.2020 15.58	JoeBiden		1249	8789	42856	The Supreme Court’s ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored.

18.6.2020 1.45	JoeBiden		5439	15774	78643	Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy — but he has surrendered the fight.

18.6.2020 0.45	JoeBiden		2251	10142	38824	Vice President Pence claimed success because COVID-19 deaths are “down to” fewer than 750 a day. That's more than 20,000 a month — and they're self-congratulating? Unbelievable. It may be good enough for President Trump, but it will never be acceptable if I am President.				1,27E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1273416386841214976

17.6.2020 15.02	JoeBiden		6741	13583	72263	The truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the United States.

16.6.2020 22.08	JoeBiden		3000	8307	39078	We have the power to write the future we want for this country.

3.5.2020 20.05	JoeBiden		3086	12058	48109	Donald Trump seems to think he can direct funding based on which politicians are nice to him, which states he’s trying to win in November, and which businesses he wants to enrich — all without any accountability. @EWarren and I think that’s unacceptable.		@ewarren		1,26E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1257038468699566089	
3.5.2020 18.58	JoeBiden		739	3399	15280	This #WorldPressFreedomDay, support for an independent press at home and around the world matters more than ever.

3.5.2020 18.58	JoeBiden		634	4033	21378	Trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. He bullies members of the press, instead of taking responsibility for his failures. His efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of reporting violate our core values and threaten our very system of government.				1,26E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1257021762602184705	
3.5.2020 18.58	JoeBiden		6609	15195	70793	A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. And it’s why Donald Trump’s efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.				1,26E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1257021761872449542

2.5.2020 19.29	JoeBiden	voxdotcom	8709	57847	161854	We left a playbook. He ignored it. We created an office to prepare for pandemics. He gutted it. We had CDC officials in China to detect and contain outbreaks. He pulled them out. Trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is his actions left us unprepared.				1,26E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1256667024912244736

It's a disgrace, and it's slowing efforts to reopen safely.

The president should encourage folks to follow Gov. Whitmer’s public health orders — not sow further discord and division.				1,26E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1256306743585370112

1.5.2020 12.57	JoeBiden		9585	12599	58469	We have lived long enough with a President who doesn’t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That’s not me.

30.4.2020 22.33	JoeBiden		1684	6218	18096	Instead of preparing our country to fight COVID-19, Donald Trump wasted months and promised it would miraculously go away by April. He was wrong. And we're all paying the price.				1,26E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1255988550522351620

19.4.2020 0.00	JoeBiden	yuenok	3022	10079	36989	The United States should be standing up for freedom and standing with the people of Hong Kong. Instead, Trump has said he's “standing with Xi Jinping.” That's weak. We need to be strong on values when it comes to China. That's what I'll do as president.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1251661920962326530

18.4.2020 14.30	JoeBiden		3945	15317	62150	Donald Trump may not like it, but it's his responsibility to step up and lead our nation's testing strategy. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and returning to some semblance of normalcy.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1251518345548935169	
17.4.2020 23.55	JoeBiden		3488	10425	45365	Donald Trump continues to do the exact thing we teach our kids not to do: blame others. It’s always somebody else's fault — never his. It’s unbelievable. We deserve better from our commander in chief.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1251298144089976832	
17.4.2020 22.20	JoeBiden		7065	13939	52042	Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for our slow, uncoordinated response. Experts say that if we had acted two weeks earlier, more lives could have been saved. Trump failed to take swift action—and we're paying the price.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1251274236808790017	
17.4.2020 19.02	JoeBiden		3571	26023	56648	President Trump is trying to rewrite history when it comes to China and COVID-19 — but the facts don't back him up. Tony Blinken was the Deputy Secretary of State and is one of my top foreign policy advisors. He'll explain.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1251224408959651840	
17.4.2020 18.02	JoeBiden		4897	19669	57130	The uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left America exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic. He ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies and put his trust in China's leaders instead. Now, we're all paying the price. Let me explain how we got here:				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1251209309284859904	
17.4.2020 16.30	JoeBiden		2393	6933	45907	I know the American people will beat this. We’re brave and big-hearted. We’ve emerged stronger from every crisis that has tested us as a nation — and we will again.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1251186157024616449	
17.4.2020 14.00	JoeBiden		3186	11970	66613	We’re in the middle of a global pandemic. No one feeling ill should have to choose between earning a paycheck or staying home to recover.

16.4.2020 22.40	JoeBiden		1612	4534	16413	Today’s news that more than 22 million people filed unemployment claims over the last month is devastating.

16.4.2020 20.50	JoeBiden		1872	5905	22762	These racist acts have got to stop. No one should be targeted for what they look like, where they or their ancestors come from, or who they are. COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together—not by targeting people of AAPI heritage.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1250889199621832704

16.4.2020 0.45	JoeBiden		1133	3496	24795	We won’t defeat this President by being like him. We’ll win by doing the opposite. Where he seeks to divide us, we’ll connect people.

12.4.2020 23.30	JoeBiden		1562	5943	23002	We're facing a crisis unlike any we've faced before — and I couldn't be prouder of how the American people are responding.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1249479913922613253	
12.4.2020 20.30	JoeBiden		1761	10355	72892	To everyone on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19, thank you. We truly couldn't get through this without you.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1249434614768132097	
12.4.2020 17.55	JoeBiden		5062	10793	43116	As we prepare to reopen America, we have to remember what this crisis has taught us: The administration’s failure to plan, to prepare, to honestly assess and communicate the threat to the nation led to catastrophic results. We cannot repeat those mistakes.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1249395607757873154	
12.4.2020 16.55	JoeBiden		594	1803	5793	Folks, we just released a special Sunday episode of Here’s the Deal! @RevDrBarber joined me for a discussion on faith and its intersection with some of the most pressing issues we face as a nation.

12.4.2020 0.00	JoeBiden		8108	15793	87673	We are in the middle of a global pandemic — and people need access to health care now more than ever. Donald Trump should reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1249125201536856066	
11.4.2020 22.00	JoeBiden		2939	7219	43377	This new enemy may be unseen, but we have the tools, the expertise, the will, and the spirit to defeat it. There is nothing the American people can't accomplish if we work together.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1249094876366503938	
11.4.2020 20.01	JoeBiden		1280	4803	18083	We need to help as many working families and small businesses as possible. Workers who have lost their jobs or seen their hours slashed and families who are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table need help immediately. There's no time to waste.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1249064929182662656	
11.4.2020 18.00	JoeBiden		1492	8265	23275	We are months into this crisis and our heroes on the front lines still don't have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. It's unconscionable. Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act immediately.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1249034481698144256	
11.4.2020 16.15	JoeBiden		11870	17386	98090	Now more than ever, we have to choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1249008054340739073	
11.4.2020 14.30	JoeBiden		2297	10811	39195	President Trump needs to do everything in his power to expand the number of testing sites and surge the number of tests.

10.4.2020 22.30	JoeBiden		956	4527	16762	No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a global pandemic. We need to freeze rent for people who lose their jobs and place a ban on evictions immediately.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1248740039007309826	
10.4.2020 21.46	JoeBiden		1611	5482	22400	We need a president who demonstrates the leadership to address every aspect of this pandemic — including the spate of racist incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders — with urgency and seriousness. Donald Trump is not that president.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1248728965172396032

10.4.2020 13.55	JoeBiden		1701	9954	30290	America’s story is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things given half a chance. This virus is tough. But together and as a nation — we're tougher. I know we’ll get through this and we’ll be stronger for it, I promise you. Keep the faith.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1248610434191679488

9.4.2020 23.30	JoeBiden		706	3369	12259	This virus can hit anyone — regardless of race, economic status, or access to power — but it doesn’t impact every community equally. It hits hardest those who are most vulnerable and who have the fewest resources. We have to do better for all our people.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1248392750812155905	
9.4.2020 23.00	JoeBiden	NPR	834	3118	11742	The devastating unemployment numbers have made one thing even clearer: We need a fourth coronavirus relief package, and we need it fast. We need to take extraordinary steps to protect American families and ensure those laid off are made financially whole.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1248385231356219396	
9.4.2020 22.39	JoeBiden		1194	4410	14929	This morning's news of another rise in unemployment claims—on top of the millions already filed—is devastating. We have to make sure those affected get the benefits they deserve, but we can't stop there. I'm announcing two new policies to help Americans get the relief they need:				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1248379915382059011	
9.4.2020 20.27	JoeBiden	nprpolitics	2844	20566	70932	I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be expanding the number of testing sites and surging the number of tests — not reducing them. Testing is key to finding a way out of this crisis.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1248346736868970497	
9.4.2020 19.32	JoeBiden		5681	9241	35572	We have to do more to ease the economic burden on working people. So today, I'm adopting two new policies to help deliver relief. As president, I will: - Lower Medicare eligibility to age 60 - Forgive student debt for low-income and middle class families				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1248332855257600006	
9.4.2020 16.20	JoeBiden		14997	21407	157263	Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for their coronavirus treatment.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1248284537165152266	
9.4.2020 15.30	JoeBiden		605	1498	6510	Eleven-year-old Isaac Johnston asked me what else kids should be doing in addition to washing their hands and staying home. My advice was simple: - Stay a safe distance from friends - Sneeze into your elbow - And eat your vegetables				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1248271953829310464	
9.4.2020 14.31	JoeBiden	CNNBusiness	1743	5310	18840	A total of about 17 million people have filed for unemployment over the last three weeks. This is unprecedented. The economic devastation that families all across this country are experiencing is not their fault. We've got to take extraordinary steps to protect them.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1248257318141267968

8.4.2020 20.50	JoeBiden		2214	7064	31643	The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but the slow and chaotic response to it is. He's the commander in chief — it's time he steps up, takes responsibility, and does his job.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1247990096957190146

But we want you to know: we’ll be reaching out. You’ll be heard by me. As you say: Not me, Us.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1247920854903767045	
8.4.2020 16.14	JoeBiden		378	1802	11361	To Bernie and Jane, as friends, from Jill and me: You haven’t just run a political campaign; you’ve created a movement. And make no mistake about it, we believe it’s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That’s a good thing for our nation and our future.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1247920853410615296	
8.4.2020 16.13	JoeBiden		5905	14104	79056	I know Bernie well. He’s a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. And it’s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. So I won’t try to.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1247920466603528193

8.4.2020 14.20	JoeBiden	NPR	721	3178	11997	It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need.

8.4.2020 1.35	JoeBiden		1413	5550	19296	We’re starting to see evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution—which disproportionately affects communities of color & low-income communities—is linked to COVID-19 death rates. It's past time we treat pollution like the threat to our health it is.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1247699431442370561	
8.4.2020 0.25	JoeBiden		2147	9121	49583	The weeks ahead will be some of the toughest we’ve ever experienced as a nation.

6.4.2020 15.35	JoeBiden		1131	7009	28196	It is close to criminal the way they’re dealing with Captain Crozier. He spoke up to protect his sailors — he should have a commendation, not be fired.				1,25E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1247186048859295745

Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks it down for us:				1,24E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1241416531684331526	
21.3.2020 16.48	JoeBiden		6076	16496	75040	The coronavirus test should be made widely available and free. The coronavirus vaccine, when ready, should be made widely available and free. Treatment for coronavirus should be free, too. We're in a crisis. No one should have to pay for their coronavirus health care costs.				1,24E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1241406213864280064

20.2.2020 22.27	JoeBiden		73	327	1387	We have to take on the @NRA and pass real reform to end our gun violence epidemic.
