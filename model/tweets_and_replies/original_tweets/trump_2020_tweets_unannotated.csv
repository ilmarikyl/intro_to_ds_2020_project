2020-09-02	1301136193913004033	RealDonaldTrump	Joe Biden is a Low Energy Candidate the likes of which we have never seen before. The last thing our country needs is a Low Energy Individulal, especially when surrounded by High Energy Chess Players scattered all over the world. He’s back in his basement now - no schedule!	True
2020-09-02	1301134325782638593	RealDonaldTrump	Joe Biden is not on the side of Law Enforcement, and that was spectacularly evident on my very successful trip yesterday to Kenosha. We solved the problem quickly, and it was very much appreciated by the people of Wisconsin. Joe Biden wouldn’t know where to begin - a bad record!	True

2020-09-02	1301092327017140224	RealDonaldTrump	Like Fredo at Fake News @CNN, the very untalented Joy Reid should be fired for this horrible use of the words “Muslim Terrorists”. Such xenophobia and racism on MSDNC. Anyone else would be gone, and fast!!! 	False
2020-09-02	1301090370508464129	RealDonaldTrump	Will Fredo be fired by Fake News @CNN? He speaks with great disrespect about women, and it will only get worse.

2020-09-02	1300983667561562118	RealDonaldTrump	Mike Pence was never put on standby, &amp; there were no mini-strokes. This is just more Fake News by @CNN, a phony story.

2020-08-31	1300258464170758144	RealDonaldTrump	....His problem is interesting. He must always be weak on CRIME because of the Bernie Sanders Radical Left voter.

2020-08-22	1297275241203458048	RealDonaldTrump	....that they are trying to pull off in violation of everything that our Country stands for.

2020-08-22	1297275235432005632	RealDonaldTrump	Representatives of the Post Office have repeatedly stated that they DO NOT NEED MONEY, and will not make changes.

2020-08-22	1297138033918173184	RealDonaldTrump	Why would Suburban Women vote for Biden and the Democrats when Democrat run cities are now rampant with crime (and they aren’t asking the Federal Government for help) which could easily spread to the suburbs, and they will reconstitute, on steroids, their low income suburbs plan!

2020-08-22	1297132096448864258	RealDonaldTrump	The Democrats took the word GOD out of the Pledge of Allegiance at the Democrat National Convention.

2020-08-20	1296597150181330944	RealDonaldTrump	The Democrats are demanding Mail-In Ballots because the enthusiasm meter for Slow Joe Biden is the lowest in recorded history, and they are concerned that very few people will turn out to vote.

2020-07-26	1287517470497083393	RealDonaldTrump	The “protesters” are actually anarchists who hate our Country. The line of innocent “mothers” were a scam that Lamestream refuses to acknowledge, just like they don’t report the violence of these demonstrations! 	False
