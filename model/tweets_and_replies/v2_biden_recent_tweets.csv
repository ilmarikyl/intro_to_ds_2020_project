2020-09-22	1308423054834401281	JoeBiden	While other nations worked around the clock to get this virus under control, our president was too busy tweeting and golfing.  Now, nearly 200,000 Americans have died.  It didn’t have to happen this way. 	False

2020-09-22	1308205622039437312	JoeBiden	Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country — and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us.	True
2020-09-22	1308195555940749316	JoeBiden	When the virus came, President Trump wasn’t thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection.  It’s how Trump looks at the world: It’s always about him, never about us.  You deserve a president who will put you first.	True
2020-09-21	1308187250883284994	JoeBiden	Thank you for the warm welcome, Manitowoc! With the help of companies like Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry, we're going to revitalize American manufacturing and make sure the future is made here in America. 	False

2020-09-19	1307424474938122245	JoeBiden	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for all of us. She was a giant of the Court and unflinching in her pursuit of equal justice under the law. Because of her life’s work, we are closer to that more perfect union we’ve always strived to be. 	False

2020-09-18	1307002947285315586	JoeBiden	When we needed Donald Trump to tell the truth about COVID-19, he lied to us.  When we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing.  When we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found.  It's unforgivable.	True
2020-09-18	1306975013355089922	JoeBiden	"Donald Trump claimed he would be ""the greatest jobs president God ever created.""  But the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history.  We can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. "	True

2020-09-18	1306756070585573378	JoeBiden	I'll tell you what takes away your freedom: not being able to see your kid, go to the football game, or see your mom or dad in the hospital. That's what is costing us our freedom. #BidenTownHall 	False
2020-09-18	1306753050623836161	JoeBiden	The choice in this election couldn’t be more clear.  We can choose four more years of Donald Trump’s dark and divisive politics.  Or we can choose a path of hope and light—and build a better future for all.  Chip in to help us win. #BidenTownHall 	True

2020-09-17	1306695924308013056	JoeBiden	No surprise, Donald Trump is lying about my tax plan. Here’s the truth about how I’ll make corporations pay their fair share while ensuring Americans making under $400,000 don’t pay a penny more. 	True

2020-09-17	1306661700054196227	JoeBiden	The 100 richest Americans have made more than $300 billion during the COVID-19 crisis.   Now, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, Donald Trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break.   Let that sink in.	True
2020-09-17	1306644082597531654	JoeBiden	If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president.  The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share — and we'll invest that money in working families.  We're going to reward work — not wealth.	False

2020-09-17	1306612373722030081	JoeBiden	We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing.    We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine.  The stakes are too high.	True
2020-09-17	1306594254765068288	JoeBiden	Yesterday, I met with some of our nation's top experts to discuss how we distribute a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.

2020-09-17	1306403748898656257	JoeBiden	"President Trump promised the opioid crisis would end ""quickly"" if he won, but the fact is drug overdose deaths are up nearly 10% across the country. It's heartbreaking.  As president, I promise I'll take action to end this epidemic. "	True
2020-09-17	1306399974276526081	JoeBiden	If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if more of America is ablaze? 	False

2020-09-16	1306334039557586944	JoeBiden	We can’t allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit.

2020-09-16	1306319984721682432	JoeBiden	We all want a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, but it needs to be based on science — not politics. Tune in as I discuss how we can develop and equitably distribute a safe and effective vaccine: 	False
2020-09-16	1306279178304536576	JoeBiden	We’ve lost nearly 200,000 Americans to COVID-19.   It didn’t have to be this bad — but Donald Trump failed to do his job.	True
2020-09-16	1306254264298213378	JoeBiden	The fact of the matter is Donald Trump doesn't have a health care plan.  I do — and you can read it here:  	True

2020-09-16	1306236396378546179	JoeBiden	Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have directly caused the record fires we’re seeing on the West Coast. But if he gets four more years in the White House, they’ll only become more common, devastating, and deadly. 	True

2020-09-16	1306053944066494465	JoeBiden	Hispanic Heritage Month is a reminder of the strength we draw as a nation from our immigrant roots. No matter where your family came from, we're here because we all share the same ideals. That's the story of America — and it is well worth celebrating. 	False
2020-09-16	1306030539783110657	JoeBiden	Donald Trump not only suggested we sell or trade Puerto Rico — but he also left our fellow Americans without the resources they desperately needed after Hurricane Maria.

2020-09-15	1305983479830593536	JoeBiden	The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing is a powerful reminder of our past and what remains at stake in this election.

2020-09-15	1305974675370106881	JoeBiden	I believe that every American deserves a fair shot to get ahead and a government that treats them equally. But that hasn't been the case for the people of Puerto Rico. Today, I'm releasing my new plan to change that: 	False
2020-09-15	1305954790711734272	JoeBiden	For months, President Trump has failed to provide desperately needed fiscal relief to our state and local governments — and we’re seeing the consequences every day.

2020-09-15	1305929147441532930	JoeBiden	The most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by those who defend our nation at war. I’m in Tampa, Florida, to hear from veterans and to discuss how I’ll honor that promise as president. Tune in: 	False

2020-09-15	1305680232469467137	JoeBiden	The fact is, Iran is closer to a nuclear bomb today than it was when Donald Trump took office.  Every day he’s in charge of our national security is another day our enemies are emboldened and the American people are at risk. 	True
2020-09-15	1305666390670675969	JoeBiden	When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks “hoax.”   I think “jobs.”  Good paying, union jobs that put Americans to work building a stronger, more climate-resilient nation. 	True

2020-09-13	1305260678991810562	JoeBiden	With each reauthorization, VAWA has become stronger.  The latest bill—passed by the House last year—would close loopholes allowing abusers to obtain guns and extend protections for Native women.

2020-09-13	1305260465585451008	JoeBiden	26 years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act became law. In the years since, it has saved countless lives and helped change the culture around sexual assault and domestic violence.

2020-09-13	1305160054346141703	JoeBiden	This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice.

2020-09-13	1304935826682458112	JoeBiden	In a Biden-Harris administration, “Buy American” will be more than a slogan.   We’re going to invest an additional $400 billion in purchasing American-made products and keep good-paying jobs here at home. 	False
2020-09-12	1304920726932041729	JoeBiden	Donald Trump and I have pretty different philosophies when it comes to giving our word.   Mine means something.   When I tell the American people I’m going to do something — I follow through. 	True

2020-09-11	1304473044916875264	JoeBiden	Nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate. Nearly 3,000 lives were cut short: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of Americans in every corner of the country. 	False
2020-09-11	1304450463920779264	JoeBiden	As a nation, we must never forget those we lost on 9/11 and the incredible bravery of our first responders.

2020-09-09	1303807139203493888	JoeBiden	Roberto Clemente was an incredible baseball player. He was a barrier breaker and a humanitarian. As he rose to fame, he lifted the Black and Latino communities with him.  I may be a Phillies fan, but I’m always proud to honor the legacy of #21. 	False

2020-08-31	1300500098233839616	JoeBiden	More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol.  Nearly one in six small businesses in this country are closed.  Do you really feel safer under Trump?	True

2020-08-31	1300461343045083136	JoeBiden	We are facing so many crises under Donald Trump:   COVID. Economic devastation. Unwarranted police violence. Emboldened white nationalists.

2020-08-30	1300218744539619336	JoeBiden	This video is doctored — and a flagrant attempt to spread misinformation at the expense of a man who uses assistive technology.   It should be removed. Now. 	False
