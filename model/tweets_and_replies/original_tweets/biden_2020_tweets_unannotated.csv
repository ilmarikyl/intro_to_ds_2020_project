2020-09-16	1306236396378546179	JoeBiden	Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have directly caused the record fires we’re seeing on the West Coast. But if he gets four more years in the White House, they’ll only become more common, devastating, and deadly. 	True

2020-09-16	1306030539783110657	JoeBiden	Donald Trump not only suggested we sell or trade Puerto Rico — but he also left our fellow Americans without the resources they desperately needed after Hurricane Maria.

2020-09-15	1305680232469467137	JoeBiden	The fact is, Iran is closer to a nuclear bomb today than it was when Donald Trump took office.  Every day he’s in charge of our national security is another day our enemies are emboldened and the American people are at risk. 	True
2020-09-15	1305666390670675969	JoeBiden	When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks “hoax.”   I think “jobs.”  Good paying, union jobs that put Americans to work building a stronger, more climate-resilient nation. 	True

2020-09-13	1305260678991810562	JoeBiden	With each reauthorization, VAWA has become stronger.

2020-09-11	1304473044916875264	JoeBiden	Nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate. Nearly 3,000 lives were cut short: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of Americans in every corner of the country. 	False
2020-09-11	1304450463920779264	JoeBiden	As a nation, we must never forget those we lost on 9/11 and the incredible bravery of our first responders. Though the wounds of that day will never fully heal, the spirit of Americans recovered as it always does — unbowed by the efforts of those who strike against it. 	False
2020-09-11	1304219355404791808	JoeBiden	Donald Trump said he wanted to be a cheerleader for the country. We didn't need a cheerleader. We needed a president.	True
2020-09-11	1304209289456672768	JoeBiden	More than 1,000 people died from COVID yesterday.  @realDonaldTrump watched eight hours of TV.  If I’m president, you might not always agree with me. But I promise you I will always show up and fight for you. 	True
2020-09-10	1304171037240619008	JoeBiden	Donald Trump is holding a rally in Michigan today—while also refusing to fully fund their National Guard.

2020-09-09	1303826768525131776	JoeBiden	If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone.   Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action — costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin.  It’s an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.	True
2020-09-09	1303807139203493888	JoeBiden	Roberto Clemente was an incredible baseball player. He was a barrier breaker and a humanitarian. As he rose to fame, he lifted the Black and Latino communities with him.  I may be a Phillies fan, but I’m always proud to honor the legacy of #21. 	False

2020-09-09	1303699681420087296	JoeBiden	President Obama and I rescued the auto industry and helped Michigan's economy come roaring back.  Donald Trump squandered it — and hardworking Michiganders are paying the price every day. 	True
2020-09-09	1303495445717512192	JoeBiden	Given his track record, no one can take Trump’s word alone on a COVID-19 vaccine. But with satisfactory answers to these questions, every American can have confidence in a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. 	True

2020-08-30	1300164707081498630	JoeBiden	We must not become a country at war with ourselves.  A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you.

2020-08-12	1293569178838929416	JoeBiden	As the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, @KamalaHarris grew up believing in the promise of America because she saw it firsthand.

2020-08-11	1293175334037262336	JoeBiden	I promise you if I'm elected, I won't waste any time getting this virus under control.  I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. I'll bring together top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.  We'll get it done, together.	False
2020-08-11	1293012127708516353	JoeBiden	This is the latest dire consequence of Donald Trump looking the other way on Beijing's repression in Hong Kong.

2020-08-10	1292928711243771911	JoeBiden	Bristol Bay is no place for a mine — our administration decided that in 2014. We're only discussing it today because Donald Trump's EPA reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's CEO. 	True
2020-08-10	1292924430272921606	JoeBiden	Donald Trump said that if he’s re-elected, he’ll defund Social Security.  We can't let that happen.	True

2020-08-10	1292870827168342017	JoeBiden	Donald Trump’s surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of Americans.   After six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through. But I do: 	True

2020-08-07	1291869982196809728	JoeBiden	I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That’s why as president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone.	True

2020-08-07	1291816882434121728	JoeBiden	Here’s the truth—Donald Trump turned his back on the middle class long before COVID-19.

2020-08-07	1291690890566737920	JoeBiden	The truth is that President Trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic—it's obvious he still hasn’t learned his lesson. He continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price. 	True

2020-08-07	1291690889174228992	JoeBiden	Gov. Ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing.

2020-08-05	1290998489975885826	JoeBiden	The truth of the matter is, Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he inherited in his life, he squandered it. 	True
2020-08-05	1290812262744305665	JoeBiden	From day one, Donald Trump downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, ignored scientists, and refused to take action.   Now, nearly 5 million cases and more than 150,000 deaths later, it's crystal clear we're paying the price for his failed leadership.	True

2020-08-04	1290670186794815491	JoeBiden	One year ago, just hours after the massacre in El Paso, nine precious lives were cut short in Dayton. In the wake of the tragedies, Donald Trump promised the most modest of gun safety policies, then caved to the @NRA and failed to deliver.	True

2020-08-03	1290383185432305666	JoeBiden	In the days that followed the El Paso shooting, I said Americans have to come together, stand against hate, and leave nobody behind.  That charge feels more important than ever. This is our fight — and together, we will win. 	False

2020-08-03	1290337132339486722	JoeBiden	This is a moment to summon the purpose we felt one year ago after El Paso. A moment to recommit to the battle for the soul of this nation. A battle against white supremacy, hatred, and gun violence.  It won't be easy — but it's a battle we must win.	False
2020-08-03	1290311966247006209	JoeBiden	One year ago, a white supremacist armed with a semi-automatic rifle targeted the people of El Paso. He thought his hatred of Latinos and immigrants would prove more powerful than the culture and vibrancy of the community.  He was wrong. 	False

2020-07-29	1288564199723921408	JoeBiden	Donald Trump has shown that he can’t beat the pandemic or turn the economy around. And he is unsurprisingly stoking the flames of division for political gain.  He is the worst possible person to lead our nation through this moment. 	True

2020-07-24	1286788247511736320	JoeBiden	The President has a duty to care for us all. To see people where they are and to understand what they’re going through.  I’ve been a single parent.

2020-07-23	1286254983961165826	JoeBiden	Every day I hear from folks who tell me how important health care is to their families — well, it's deeply personal for President @BarackObama and me, too. I'll fight to protect and build on Obamacare and make sure everyone gets the care they need.  Watch our conversation: 	False
2020-07-23	1286089896310931457	JoeBiden	Let me be clear: If vote-by-mail is good enough for Donald Trump and his administration, then it's good enough for all of us. 	True
2020-07-22	1286072279764537349	JoeBiden	I know everything feels different right now. There’s just that feeling where you don’t know if everything will be okay. But I promise you that it can be and it will be. 	False
2020-07-22	1286048372198014976	JoeBiden	Today, the House passed the #NoBanAct because no one should be discriminated against or singled out based on the faith they practice. I will end President Trump's Muslim Ban on day one and sign this bill into law.	True
2020-07-22	1286042584083607552	JoeBiden	My plan to create a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce will put 3 million Americans to work — and free up millions more people to join the paid labor force.

2020-07-22	1286027988065124352	JoeBiden	The goal of the Census is clear: count every person. But Donald Trump continues to use this vital process to sow division and scare immigrant communities.  We won't let him deny communities the funding and representation they deserve. Because in America, everyone counts. 	True
2020-07-22	1286003073786281985	JoeBiden	The words of a president matter. And from the moment President Trump came down that escalator, he has used his to degrade people and sow division. It's not who we are.  Watch my full conversation with President @BarackObama tomorrow at 10 AM ET. 	True

2020-07-22	1285776581554614272	JoeBiden	10 years ago the Obama-Biden Administration signed Wall Street reform to prevent the abuse that led to the Great Recession.

2020-07-21	1285640937725542400	JoeBiden	Home health workers do God’s work, but aren’t paid much. They have few benefits, and 40% are still on SNAP or Medicaid. It's unacceptable.  I'll give caregivers and early childhood educators a much-needed raise.	False
2020-07-21	1285640182700453888	JoeBiden	We need to make high-quality child care affordable and accessible. As president, I'll give every 3- and 4-year-old access to free, high-quality preschool.

2020-07-21	1285639176017215488	JoeBiden	We are trapped in a caregiving crisis, within an economic crisis, within a public health crisis. You’re doing everything you can, but this president is not.  If I’m your president, here’s what I would do: 	False
2020-07-21	1285638169443041280	JoeBiden	Donald Trump simply doesn’t understand: We can’t deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis.   And for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help the working families hit the hardest.	True
2020-07-21	1285636224032505856	JoeBiden	We have to mobilize a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation. Today, I'm delivering remarks about how we're going to get it done. Tune in: 	False

2020-07-21	1285368895155474432	JoeBiden	Folks, it may be hard to believe, but we have just over 100 days until Election Day. I know we can beat Donald Trump and build this nation back better than before — but we need your help to do it.  If you're able, please chip in today: 	True
2020-07-20	1285350020942901255	JoeBiden	Small manufacturers like McGregor Industries demonstrate the resilience, creativity, and staying-power of America’s industrial base.  Together we're going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America. 	False

2020-07-19	1284933527088365569	JoeBiden	Mr. President, your ignorance isn’t a virtue or a sign of your strength — it’s undercutting our response to this unprecedented crisis at every turn and it’s costing Americans their jobs and their lives. 	False
2020-07-19	1284912638577655808	JoeBiden	The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad, but Donald Trump ignored the experts and refused to take action. He has failed our nation. 	True

2020-07-17	1284259082254217216	JoeBiden	Today, we lost a giant of the civil rights movement and a relentless champion in the struggle for justice. Reverend C.T.

2020-07-17	1284190127896629248	JoeBiden	Everyone wants our schools to reopen. The question is how to make it safe and how to make it stick. Forcing educators and students back into classrooms in areas where infection rates are going up or remaining too high is just plain dangerous. 	False
2020-07-17	1284174776861372417	JoeBiden	We have to make the places we live, work, and learn healthier and more energy-efficient. That's why my administration will upgrade 4 million buildings and weatherize 2 million homes across the country — creating over one million jobs in the process. 	False

2020-07-16	1283906760865005569	JoeBiden	From day one, Donald Trump has been focused on the stock market and delivering for his wealthy friends and big corporations.  As president, I will be laser-focused on working families and small businesses. 	True
2020-07-16	1283871025197748224	JoeBiden	Let's call this what it is: A modern-day poll tax. It's unconscionable.  We need to restore voting rights for individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — and ensure everyone can make their voice heard at the ballot box. 	False
2020-07-16	1283856429129125894	JoeBiden	We are months into this crisis, and our health care workers are still being forced to reuse masks. It’s unacceptable.  Mr. President, fix the PPE shortages before you tee off for yet another round of golf.	False

2020-07-10	1281726645376819202	JoeBiden	Determination. Resilience. Grit. The strength to get up no matter how many times you’ve been knocked down.

2020-07-09	1281331038476619776	JoeBiden	I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past.   American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, and must be part of the engine of American prosperity now.	False
2020-07-09	1281326005609615360	JoeBiden	We can't just focus on the jobs of today — we have to also focus on the jobs and industries of tomorrow.

2020-07-09	1281323488846860288	JoeBiden	When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products &amp; support American jobs.  But under Trump, the rate of federal contractors offshoring jobs more than doubled. It's unacceptable.  I'll invest $400 billion in American-made products &amp; keep jobs here at home. 	True
2020-07-09	1281302797535727617	JoeBiden	I'm in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, to discuss my plan to create jobs, raise wages, and help America build back better. Tune in to watch: 	False
2020-07-09	1281253024808271878	JoeBiden	We're in the middle of an economic crisis. But it's not enough to just turn things around — we have to build back better.

2020-07-08	1280974438993997829	JoeBiden	Trump launched his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans rapists.  He's spread racism against our Latino community ever since.  We need to work in partnership with Mexico.  We need to restore dignity and humanity to our immigration system.  That's what I'll do as President.	True
2020-07-08	1280950782909538304	JoeBiden	Let me be clear: No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic because they can’t pay rent. 	False
2020-07-08	1280923603744296962	JoeBiden	When there were 15 cases, the President said it wouldn't spread any farther.   We just hit our 3 millionth case.  We're paying for his failure. 	False

We may not agree on everything, but this we do: Health care is a right — not a privilege. And we're going to make that a reality, together. 	False
2020-07-08	1280667921916854273	JoeBiden	This is a national disgrace. We have to ensure these communities get the care they need immediately — and then tackle racial disparities in health care and our economy head-on. 	False
2020-07-07	1280651561518002177	JoeBiden	The most sacred obligation of our government is to keep our troops safe when we send them into battle — and to care for them when they come home. We need a president who will honor that obligation. 	False
2020-07-07	1280620310539231237	JoeBiden	Across the world, people come to this country with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future. They study here, innovate here, they make America who we are. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does. 	True
2020-07-07	1280603719831359489	JoeBiden	Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health. On my first day as President, I will rejoin the @WHO and restore our leadership on the world stage. 	False
2020-07-07	1280584871841165312	JoeBiden	We've seen what happens when the federal government fails to secure sufficient supplies of critical products like PPE — and we can't let it happen again. So today, I'm releasing my plan to rebuild U.S. supply chains: 	False

2020-07-07	1280305532843298816	JoeBiden	There’s enormous opportunity once we defeat Donald Trump. We are going to build our health care system, our economy, and our country back better than they've ever been before.	True
2020-07-06	1280279610505084928	JoeBiden	The nation is crying out for leadership — leadership that can unite us and bring us together. But this president has nothing to offer. 	False
2020-07-06	1280235066975797251	JoeBiden	With COVID-19 surging across the nation, Donald Trump should be doing everything in his power to increase access to testing. Instead, he's doing the opposite. It's despicable.	True

2020-07-05	1279897844837683203	JoeBiden	There are so many unsung heroes in our communities, especially in times of crisis. We owe Alassane and countless others a debt of gratitude — and I'll fight for them every day in the White House. 	False
2020-07-05	1279885489554755594	JoeBiden	On this Venezuelan Independence Day, my thoughts are with Venezuelans who continue to work tirelessly for the cause of democracy.

2020-07-05	1279867648218664960	JoeBiden	COVID-19 is surging across the nation, and this president is doubling down on his efforts to rip health insurance and protections away from millions. It's heartless and cruel and must be stopped.	False
2020-07-05	1279837447732396033	JoeBiden	Donald Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved so that he can get back to his campaign rallies. But he’s wrong — on both fronts.  We need a president who will actually do the work needed to get us through these crises.	True
2020-07-05	1279807751426674688	JoeBiden	The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad, but Donald Trump ignored the warnings and refused to take action. He failed our nation. 	True

2020-07-03	1279154194709016576	JoeBiden	It’s abundantly clear that this virus isn’t going to just “fade away,” Mr. President. It’s time for you to step up, take action, and lead. 	False

2020-06-25	1276252130731610112	JoeBiden	While President Trump continues his victory lap, over 20 million Americans remain out of work. He may have forgotten about you, but I never will — and I'll fight for you every single day in the White House. 	True
2020-06-25	1276225221486243840	JoeBiden	While the Trump Administration continues their efforts to rip health care away from millions, I'm speaking about how we can make quality, affordable health care available to every American.  Tune in: 	True
2020-06-25	1276218601528229888	JoeBiden	Health care workers are selflessly risking their lives every day on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 — and hundreds have paid the ultimate price.  They are American heroes — and we cannot forget the sacrifices they made to care for us all. 	False
2020-06-25	1276197965451780096	JoeBiden	Democracy is under threat globally. Restoring the soul of America means fixing democracy at home, and confronting — not cozying up to — dictators around the world. When I'm president, America will defend democracy at home and abroad. 	False
2020-06-25	1276172044925722625	JoeBiden	Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few.	False
2020-06-24	1275941587596595200	JoeBiden	This virus is not just going to disappear because you want it to, Mr. President.  Listen to the experts. Take clear, concrete action. Do your job. 	False
2020-06-24	1275919129292095488	JoeBiden	"Tonight, @DrBiden and I will be hosting ""A Community of Pride"" to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the world's first Pride march. Join us, @theebillyporter, @jvn, @catcora, and @K_JeanPierre at 7:30 PM ET:  "	False
2020-06-24	1275903127808618504	JoeBiden	I am proud to have the @NRDC_AF, under the exceptional leadership of my friend Gina McCarthy, by my side. Together, we'll lead the world in a clean energy revolution that will help us reduce our carbon emissions and create good-paying union jobs. 	False
2020-06-24	1275876391389728768	JoeBiden	Ignore the polls.   Register to vote:  	False
2020-06-24	1275842575803527169	JoeBiden	Brian — the courage and strength you've shown in the face of daunting odds is an inspiration to us all. I'm confident that with folks like you leading the way and with the power of our best minds, we'll find treatments and cures and beat this thing once and for all. 	False
2020-06-24	1275812425120444416	JoeBiden	Workers called back on the job deserve access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing.	False
2020-06-24	1275609235171180545	JoeBiden	Instead of passing police reform or helping hardworking Americans get through this crisis, Republicans are jamming through another one of Trump’s unqualified nominees. It's wrong.  Cory Wilson lacks judicial temperament and experience—and has no place on a Federal Court. 	True
2020-06-24	1275597508903747584	JoeBiden	We need a president who will expand access to quality, affordable health care — not rip it away.	False
2020-06-23	1275575614607691776	JoeBiden	To everyone who is scared, hurting, and wondering what's going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I hear you. And I'll fight for you every single day in the White House. 	False

2020-06-23	1275522767094517760	JoeBiden	The American people are tough, resilient, and always full of hope. There’s not a single thing we can't do if we do it together.	False
2020-06-23	1275496343872712705	JoeBiden	It's clear Donald Trump will stop at nothing to tear down Obamacare and rip health care away from millions. We cannot let him get away with it. We have to build on the ACA with a new public option to ensure everyone receives the care they deserve. 	True
2020-06-23	1275467864544366596	JoeBiden	It's pretty simple: If we want to save people's jobs and save people's lives, we need more testing — and we need it faster. The President is intentionally slowing it down. 	False
2020-06-23	1275430918946263041	JoeBiden	This is yet another attempt to distract from this Administration's failure to lead an effective response to COVID-19. Immigrants help grow our economy and create jobs. The President can't scapegoat his way out of this crisis. 	False
2020-06-23	1275233359615180800	JoeBiden	It's worth repeating that this weekend, President Trump admitted he directed his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in the middle of a global pandemic.  He continues to prove just how unfit he is to lead our nation.	True
2020-06-23	1275218260116549633	JoeBiden	To Ashley, and all the health care workers on the front lines of this fight, thank you. You are American heroes. 	False
2020-06-22	1275203915403927555	JoeBiden	Tomorrow, President @BarackObama and I are hosting a virtual grassroots fundraiser. We’ll be answering some of your questions and taking a few trips down memory lane. You won’t want to miss it.   Time is running out to reserve your spot. RSVP today: 	False
2020-06-22	1275164153817321473	JoeBiden	The strength of the LGBTQ+ community has always been rooted in the ability to find hope in spite of setbacks. If we stand together #UnitedByPride, we'll get through this — and emerge stronger. 	False
2020-06-22	1275151570410393612	JoeBiden	No one should have to choose between their paycheck and their health. That's why my plan for a safe and effective reopening ensures everyone has access to testing and paid leave for all those who get sick from COVID-19.  Read more here: 	False
2020-06-22	1275109292014620672	JoeBiden	We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.  We can't stand by and let that happen.	True
2020-06-22	1275057198687596545	JoeBiden	From my days as a public defender to my time as Vice President — I've spent my career fighting against injustice. And I'm not finished yet. 	False
2020-06-22	1274910217508196352	JoeBiden	Trump talks tough on Venezuela, but admires thugs and dictators like Nicolas Maduro.   As President, I will stand with the Venezuelan people and for democracy. 	True
2020-06-22	1274899809791508480	JoeBiden	Trump opposed sanctioning China’s government over its atrocious human rights violations to protect his hollow trade deal and serve his own personal interests.  Where Trump has been weak, I will be strong, clear, and consistent in standing up for America's values and its people. 	True
2020-06-21	1274850243671097347	JoeBiden	My dad instilled a lot in me, but perhaps most important is the belief that there’s no higher calling than to be a good parent. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads working to help raise their children — and all our children — to be honorable, generous, and kind. 	False
2020-06-21	1274821636466892806	JoeBiden	I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be speeding up testing — not slowing it down. 	False
2020-06-21	1274785156050464768	JoeBiden	It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress. If we stand together, as one America, we'll rise stronger than before. 	False
2020-06-21	1274535081470824451	JoeBiden	Speed up the testing.	False
2020-06-21	1274503550358478850	JoeBiden	I've found that the way to overcome enormous tragedy in your life is to turn that grief and pain into purpose. Christian Cooper and I discussed how we can take our collective pain in this moment and turn it into a catalyst for change: 	False
2020-06-20	1274486151714353152	JoeBiden	This nation has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope, but Trump has made it clear that he does not believe our country should be a place of refuge.   As president, I'll recommit to building a more inclusive and welcoming America. #WorldRefugeeDay   	True
2020-06-20	1274467563745865729	JoeBiden	Folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in 2012 — but I'm not the one who took a real risk. Countless others did the hard work and paid a price just for being themselves. Christian Cooper and I discussed the trailblazers who came before us and the work that remains: 	False
2020-06-20	1274452967211569155	JoeBiden	Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.  Unbelievable.	True
2020-06-20	1274425788117417986	JoeBiden	The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history — and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long.  It’s time we reckon with what happened in 1921. 	False
2020-06-20	1274392820938309634	JoeBiden	Christian Cooper’s encounter in Central Park was another wake-up call for our nation and a reminder of the work that remains to root out hate and intolerance. I'm grateful for Christian's support and know with folks like him leading the way, we'll get the job done. 	False
2020-06-20	1274362370375274496	JoeBiden	We're months into this pandemic and still don't have proper testing, PPE, or clear nationwide guidance. Instead, Donald Trump:  - Pushes dangerous, disproven drugs - Stands in the way of the CDC - Refuses to wear a mask  He is failing even the most basic test of leadership.	True
2020-06-20	1274137388227465216	JoeBiden	I know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. But ours is a union worth fighting for — and we are all called to the cause.  None of us can turn away. None of us can stay silent.	False
2020-06-19	1274115997029421056	JoeBiden	Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives — and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.	True
2020-06-19	1274081268142137350	JoeBiden	I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important — who we want to be. It’s all at stake.  That's the case we're making in our first TV ad of the general election: 	False
2020-06-19	1274052578876088320	JoeBiden	On June 19, 1865, in Galveston, TX, the last enslaved African Americans were finally given notice of their freedom. 155 years later, we're still on the long road to equality, equity, and fairness for all.  We can't rest until the promise of this nation is fulfilled. #Juneteenth 	False
2020-06-19	1274033704587767814	JoeBiden	#Juneteenth reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity—but it's also a reminder of our ability to change. Together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all.	False
2020-06-19	1273816170081193984	JoeBiden	Amy — from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. You know how to get things done. With your help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump. 	True
2020-06-19	1273793874226544641	JoeBiden	Climate change is linked to increased pregnancy risks — and heartbreakingly, Black mothers are being hit the hardest. As President, I'll work every day to tackle the climate crisis head-on and root out injustice. Because they are intertwined. 	False
2020-06-19	1273786324512763904	JoeBiden	To all the Dreamers who make our country better and stronger every single day: Thank you. This country needs you. #HomeIsHere 	False
2020-06-19	1273778774849404928	JoeBiden	The decisions of the last few days should remind us all of the immense power of the Supreme Court — and the generational impact its justices can have.  We have the power to shape the Court's future this November — and we can’t forget that.	False
2020-06-19	1273767450543304705	JoeBiden	I'm ready on day one. After more than three years in office, why isn't Donald Trump ready? 	True
2020-06-18	1273753609302351872	JoeBiden	Dreamers are Americans. Period.	False
2020-06-18	1273740271214227456	JoeBiden	Just like Donald Trump couldn’t wish COVID-19 away in March, and just like he couldn’t tweet it away in April — he can’t ignore it away in June. 	True
2020-06-18	1273722153301655554	JoeBiden	Here’s my promise to you: On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress that creates a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and 11 million undocumented people who are already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue.	False
2020-06-18	1273701510380126212	JoeBiden	It didn’t have to be this bad. But we have a president who is more interested in taking a victory lap than he is in doing the work needed to solve this crisis.  We need a president who will put the American people first — and actually do the work. 	False
2020-06-18	1273678505901948928	JoeBiden	Thanks, Barack. You're right — and we won't stop until every Dreamer feels safe in this country. 	False
2020-06-18	1273670561864929280	JoeBiden	Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he has inherited in his life, he has squandered it. 	True
2020-06-18	1273646151024214016	JoeBiden	The Supreme Court’s ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored. And as President, I will get to work immediately to make it permanent. 	False
2020-06-18	1273431486339796994	JoeBiden	Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy — but he has surrendered the fight.  Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated.	True
2020-06-18	1273416386841214976	JoeBiden	Vice President Pence claimed success because COVID-19 deaths are “down to” fewer than 750 a day.  That's more than 20,000 a month — and they're self-congratulating? Unbelievable.  It may be good enough for President Trump, but it will never be acceptable if I am President. 	True
2020-06-18	1273410413569495040	JoeBiden	I’m proud to stand with folks across the country participating in today’s #WorkersFirst Caravan. Senate Republicans need to pass the #HeroesAct now and take action to root out systemic racism. 	False
2020-06-17	1273398770944770048	JoeBiden	If John Bolton's accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Donald Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values.	True
2020-06-17	1273361303973900289	JoeBiden	Donald Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action necessary to contain it — and now in many states, COVID cases are on the rise again.  This president has failed to lead our nation. 	True
2020-06-17	1273333339710160896	JoeBiden	Five years ago, nine good souls were ripped from this world — killed by hate and white supremacy. Today, we honor the memory of the Emanuel Nine and the unspeakable grace of those they left behind. 	False
2020-06-17	1273321785027518464	JoeBiden	I'm in Darby, Pennsylvania, to discuss how we can make sure the country's reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in: 	False
2020-06-17	1273269670796288002	JoeBiden	The truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the United States.  It has to change.	False

2020-06-16	1273034393175625730	JoeBiden	I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is running the most corrupt administration in modern American history. 	True
2020-06-16	1273014488858583040	JoeBiden	We have the power to write the future we want for this country. One where health care is a right, we lead the world in the fight against climate change, we end our gun violence epidemic, and our government works for all — not just the powerful.  Let’s do it together.	False
2020-06-16	1272989827282001921	JoeBiden	We can’t forget that in the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is trying to gut Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.	True
2020-06-16	1272940249648377856	JoeBiden	Systemic racism pervades every part of our society, including law enforcement — and we have to do the hard work to root it out. In January, I sat down with Jake, a field organizer on our campaign, to listen to what he had to say and discuss how we can move forward: 	False
2020-06-16	1272911057330167813	JoeBiden	This virus won’t just go away because you want it to, Mr. President. It’s time for you to step up and do your job.	False
2020-06-16	1272715518743584768	JoeBiden	Los Dreamers son estadounidenses. Trump les quitó la protección que lograron con tanto esfuerzo. Esto es inaceptable. El primer día de mi presidencia enviaré un proyecto de ley al Congreso que protegerá a los beneficiarios de DACA de la deportación. 	True

2020-06-16	1272687836349837313	JoeBiden	Dreamers are Americans. But Trump's ripped away the hard-won protections of DACA recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval. It’s unacceptable, and on day one of my presidency I will protect them from deportation and send a bill to Congress. 	True
2020-06-15	1272663928728743937	JoeBiden	I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.   It's up to all of us to do the hard work to ensure the American ideal finally wins out. 	True
2020-06-15	1272631315775586306	JoeBiden	I'm grateful for @PPact's support and proud to stand with them in this fight. As president, I’m going to do everything in my power to expand access to quality, affordable health care — including reproductive health care. 	False
2020-06-15	1272619889501454337	JoeBiden	Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he does bear full responsibility for his slow, uncoordinated, bungled response. 	True
2020-06-15	1272579623285448706	JoeBiden	Race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities. We need to tackle systemic racism head-on and ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American dream.  Here’s what I would do as president: 	False
2020-06-15	1272557729257672704	JoeBiden	Today's decision is another step in our march toward equality for all. The Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect. But we're not done. 	False
2020-06-15	1272318150525280257	JoeBiden	After reports of wealthy Trump donors getting millions in relief meant for small businesses, the administration is now refusing to disclose where the PPP money went. It's unacceptable.  The American people deserve answers. 	True

2020-06-14	1272268573646315525	JoeBiden	We need a president who heals — not one who fans the flames of hate.   We need a president who unites — not one who sows further discord for political gain.   We need a president who leads the way with a steady hand — not one who incites violence with his erratic tweets.	False
2020-06-14	1272223527035265025	JoeBiden	We’re facing some of the greatest challenges in our nation’s history — and it’s clear Donald Trump isn’t up for the job.  We need real leadership, right now.	True

2020-06-13	1271814582265188352	JoeBiden	I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is truer today than ever. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation.   We can’t let that happen.	True
2020-06-13	1271611242285686784	JoeBiden	In light of Donald Trump's inhumane reversal of protections for transgender people, I want to share a conversation I had a few weeks ago. Adi deserves to be treated with the same respect and dignity as anyone else. Period. 	True
2020-06-13	1271604689809833991	JoeBiden	On the fourth anniversary of Pulse. In the middle of Pride month. During a global pandemic.  Donald Trump's cruelty truly knows no bounds. We have to defeat him this November. 	True
2020-06-12	1271572403563507712	JoeBiden	Two years after Trump's Singapore meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the U.S. and our allies are less safe and Kim's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles keeps growing. Photo-ops and love letters are no substitute for deterrence and principled diplomacy. 	True
2020-06-12	1271559904105385984	JoeBiden	"Medgar Evers once said, ""freedom has never been free."" On this day in 1963, he paid the ultimate price in pursuit of freedom for his brothers and sisters.

2020-06-12	1271537758075367424	JoeBiden	Four years ago today, 49 lives were cut short in an act of unspeakable terrorism at Pulse nightclub.

2020-06-12	1271494978213040128	JoeBiden	We need real policing reform, and we need it now. Congress should immediately:  - Outlaw chokeholds - Improve oversight and accountability - Create a model use of force standard - Stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces	False
2020-06-12	1271464778238537729	JoeBiden	Donald Trump forgot about COVID-19, but COVID-19 didn’t forget about us.   The President couldn’t wish away the virus in April, he couldn’t tweet it away in May, and he can’t ignore it away in June.	True

2020-06-11	1271114211410706432	JoeBiden	So far, Facebook has failed to enact any real reforms to stop the spread of disinformation on its platform. Time is running out.   Today, we're releasing an open letter demanding the company change its policies: 	False
2020-06-11	1271114210613899264	JoeBiden	Folks, we saw in 2016 what can happen when social media platforms are left unchecked and allow disinformation to run rampant. It puts the very integrity of our elections at risk.   We simply cannot let it happen again in 2020.	False

2020-06-09	1270409071250812930	JoeBiden	My Dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.

2020-06-08	1270131491935223809	JoeBiden	At every turn, President Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people — and we’re all paying the price every single day. 	True

2020-06-07	1269743435734384641	JoeBiden	These disparities have plagued our nation for far too long. It’s time we rebuild our country upon more just and equal foundations — and finally close race-based wealth and income gaps. 	False

2020-06-06	1269411246228586505	JoeBiden	I promised George Floyd's family that he wouldn’t just become another hashtag — and I intend to keep that promise.   We need justice. And we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again.	False

2020-06-05	1269024950477746179	JoeBiden	This #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I am reflecting on the life of Hadiya Pendleton, whose murder inspired the #WearOrange movement.  The hard truth is that Black Americans are ten times more likely to die by gun homicide. It has to stop.	False

2020-06-05	1268973258537402371	JoeBiden	George Floyd’s last words, “I can’t breathe,” have echoed across our nation and around the world.  For the President to try to put any other words in his mouth is frankly despicable. 	False

2020-06-04	1268663821998206978	JoeBiden	It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.	False

2020-06-04	1268349248170536962	JoeBiden	There’s no time to waste — we need to get to work immediately on real police reform. Congressman @Hakeem_Jeffries has a bill to outlaw chokeholds. Congress should put it on President Trump’s desk in the next few days. Period. 	True

2020-06-03	1268325843949907968	JoeBiden	Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him.  I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? 	True

2020-06-02	1267841150326636545	JoeBiden	I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.  Who we are. What we believe.

2020-06-02	1267832845608747009	JoeBiden	The President held up a bible at St. John’s church yesterday.

2020-06-02	1267634400080117761	JoeBiden	He's using the American military against the American people.  He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.  For a photo.

2020-06-01	1267570366227988482	JoeBiden	In this moment, the very soul of America is at stake.   We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.

2020-05-30	1266799536871112707	JoeBiden	Every day that Donald Trump spends in the White House, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. He is wholly unfit to be president. 	True
2020-05-30	1266527243699970049	JoeBiden	This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.  This is a national crisis — and we need real leadership right now.	False
2020-05-29	1266515917917302789	JoeBiden	We are a country with an open wound.  None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words — “I can’t breathe” — and do nothing.  We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. 	False
2020-05-29	1266489745682595841	JoeBiden	It’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.  It’s time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation.  We need justice for George Floyd.	False

2020-05-29	1266369893403770886	JoeBiden	I will not lift the President’s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I’m furious, and you should be too.	False
2020-05-29	1266369892325838850	JoeBiden	This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything.	False

2020-05-28	1266098165511380992	JoeBiden	Thirty years ago, I proudly cosponsored the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an enormous step forward, but there's more work to do. So today, I’m releasing my plan to achieve full participation and equality for people with disabilities: 	False

2020-05-27	1265770716550574086	JoeBiden	.@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Larry Kramer, an American hero.

2020-05-27	1265757168504049664	JoeBiden	There are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. Today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to this virus.  To those hurting, I'm so sorry for your loss. The nation grieves with you. 	False
2020-05-27	1265726466051977218	JoeBiden	Over the last few months, countless Asian Americans have been threatened, attacked, and blamed for COVID-19. They've cruelly been made the scapegoat by the most powerful man on the planet, President Trump. It has to end.  Read more from @TammyforIL and me: 	True
2020-05-27	1265689220603150337	JoeBiden	We’re in the middle of a global pandemic — and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he’s also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.  It’s morally reprehensible.	True

2020-05-27	1265472291099549699	JoeBiden	Last year California passed #AB5, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.

2020-05-27	1265455605076185089	JoeBiden	George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.  I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions. The FBI should conduct a thorough investigation. 	False

2020-05-27	1265435045780570112	JoeBiden	Donald Trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. It's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.  We need a government that works for all — not just the super-wealthy.	True
2020-05-26	1265417430194630659	JoeBiden	The truth is asking for money is the worst part of running for president—especially in times as tough as these.

2020-05-26	1265289085150736384	JoeBiden	We are months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a comprehensive plan when it comes to COVID-19 or the economy. It's unacceptable.

2020-05-25	1264995588594073602	JoeBiden	This ruling goes a long way toward protecting the sacred right to vote, but there's still work to do. We've got to ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voice heard at the ballot box. 	False

2020-05-24	1264706495096262662	JoeBiden	The presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. It requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Donald Trump simply wasn’t prepared for that. I promise you I will be.	True
2020-05-24	1264681329158795264	JoeBiden	Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and time is running out to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle the challenge head-on.	True
2020-05-24	1264654905714728960	JoeBiden	Hunger today isn’t about scarcity — it’s about a massive failure in leadership.   If I were President, I’d immediately work with @chefjoseandres to empower our restaurants to be part of the solution as families go hungry during the COVID-19 crisis. 	False

2020-05-24	1264600798865944577	JoeBiden	Folks write letters to me asking all kinds of questions, but Jack's question on my favorite ice cream flavor might be the best one yet.  Here’s what I told him:  	False

2020-05-24	1264357467275886592	JoeBiden	This is jarring — and a heartbreaking reminder that the death toll we see in the news is so much more than just a statistic.

2020-05-23	1264264835036000257	JoeBiden	The hard truth is Donald Trump ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.  It’s one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.	True

2020-05-22	1263887347650899970	JoeBiden	I've said it before, and I'll say it again: No company pulling in billions of dollars in profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.  It's time for Amazon to pay its fair share. 	False

2020-05-21	1263259697177677826	JoeBiden	Donald Trump is using a global health crisis as an excuse to deport children and continue separating families. It's heartless and un-American.

2020-05-13	1260701573765836805	JoeBiden	Enough with the anger and division and fear-mongering, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up, appeal to our better angels, and unite the country. We'll overcome this crisis by coming together — not by tearing each other apart. 	False
2020-05-13	1260664864269381635	JoeBiden	It didn’t have to be this bad. Donald Trump utterly failed to prepare for this pandemic and delayed in taking the necessary steps to safeguard our nation against the near-worst-case-economic scenario we are now living. 	True
2020-05-13	1260639698529193986	JoeBiden	We owe so much to every single worker on the front lines of this crisis. The least we can do is provide them the pay and protection they need and deserve. Here's what I would do if I were president: 	False

2020-05-13	1260607989070786560	JoeBiden	A united party is key to winning the White House this November. The work of the task forces will be essential to identifying ways to build on our progress and not simply turn the clock back to a time before Donald Trump — but transform our country. 	True
2020-05-13	1260570499320446976	JoeBiden	Donald Trump can put up all of the banners he wants in the Rose Garden, but it doesn’t change the fact that he failed our nation when it comes to COVID-19 testing. 	True

2020-05-12	1260155255880323074	JoeBiden	Let me be clear: My Administration will review every single stimulus loan given to big companies and political insiders. We will find any dollar taken corruptly, we will come get it, and we will punish the wrongdoers. 	False

2020-05-11	1259972803660443648	JoeBiden	In April, we raised $60.5 million between my campaign and @TheDemocrats. I'm humbled and know what a sacrifice it is to give in times as difficult as these.

2020-05-11	1259943863621267457	JoeBiden	Donald Trump and his team seem to understand how critical testing is to their own safety. So why are they insisting that it’s unnecessary for the American people?	True

2020-05-11	1259896551805157378	JoeBiden	Donald Trump hopes to split us into dueling camps, casting Democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep America grounded and Republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy.  It’s a childish tactic—and a false choice none of us should fall for. 	True
2020-05-11	1259855842041565186	JoeBiden	I have a better idea: give people coronavirus economic relief and don't hold their hard-earned benefits hostage. 	False

2020-05-10	1259626773605564416	JoeBiden	.@AndrewYang and I covered a lot of ground on the next episode of Here's the Deal, but the most surprising part might have been learning about his connection to the Roosevelts.  Make sure to tune in for the full episode tomorrow morning:  	False

2020-05-10	1259581475109744640	JoeBiden	Tax cuts for the super-wealthy. Bailouts for large corporations. Working Americans left behind.  That’s Donald Trump’s record. 	True

2020-05-08	1258908289334640644	JoeBiden	Make no mistake: COVID-19 has caused a massive economic challenge. But this crisis hit us harder, and will last longer, because Donald Trump spent the last three years undermining the core pillars of our economic strength. 	True
2020-05-08	1258886898329812998	JoeBiden	Two years ago, Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran Deal.

True
2020-05-08	1258874315518300162	JoeBiden	Corruption is a feature of Donald Trump's economic agenda—not a bug. He will pick his wealthy friends and corporate cronies over working families every time.

2020-05-08	1258784976834887689	JoeBiden	Donald Trump loves to crow about what a great economy he built.  This crisis has revealed what a failure Trumponomics has been. And American workers and families are paying the price.   Tune in for my remarks live on @nowthisnews at 12 PM EDT.	True

2020-05-07	1258184774486642688	JoeBiden	I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: No one is expendable. No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow.	False
2020-05-06	1258161115944681478	JoeBiden	The nurses on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes.

2020-05-06	1258095433886375940	JoeBiden	We can’t sit by as Donald Trump and Republicans use COVID-19 as an excuse to disenfranchise voters. We need to ensure people have the opportunity to vote by mail, early vote, vote absentee and, in every way possible, safely vote in person this November. 	True

2020-05-06	1257876833581912065	JoeBiden	The video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood. My heart goes out to his family, who deserve justice and deserve it now. It is time for a swift, full, and transparent investigation into his murder. 	False
2020-05-06	1257841258354970624	JoeBiden	This didn't have to happen. The Trump Administration failed to take action and produce desperately needed protective equipment — and those on the front lines of this crisis paid the price. It's heartbreaking. 	True
2020-05-06	1257827550216302593	JoeBiden	The Biden Administration will not silence scientists. 	False
2020-05-05	1257818848591351809	JoeBiden	The choice between the economy and public health is a false one—if we don’t beat the virus, we'll never get back to full economic strength and will lose countless lives. We have to get the number of new cases down and scale up testing before we return to some sense of normalcy. 	False
2020-05-05	1257795708339421186	JoeBiden	It’s important to stay connected while we’re social distancing — but there’s always that one friend who doesn’t get the hint when it’s time to end the video chat.   Glad we don’t know anyone like that — right, @KeeganMKey? 	False
2020-05-05	1257731791302979584	JoeBiden	It's been a big few weeks. President Obama, Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and Speaker Pelosi all endorsed our campaign. Now, we need your help to keep the momentum going.  I know times are tough, but if you can, please chip in today: 	False
2020-05-05	1257697813208674305	JoeBiden	Each week, I get hundreds of letters from people across the country. Folks share their hopes, ideas, struggles, and concerns — and I try to respond to as many as I can. We're going to share a few of them with you in our new series: Sincerely, Joe. 	False
2020-05-05	1257677680662765568	JoeBiden	Thank you to all the:  Firefighters Paramedics Police officers Doctors Nurses Medical support staff Grocery and retail workers Meatpackers Delivery drivers Transit workers And everyone else on the front lines of this fight.  You truly are the heart and soul of this country.	False
2020-05-05	1257474844008108034	JoeBiden	Let me be clear: Essential workers on the front lines of this crisis deserve premium pay, emergency paid sick leave, and protections that keep them safe.	False
2020-05-04	1257457336551079939	JoeBiden	Across the country, folks are stepping up, taking care of their neighbors, and lending a hand to those in need. It's who we are. In times of crisis, we stand as one. And it makes me so proud to be an American. 	False
2020-05-04	1257424764097802240	JoeBiden	Today, I’m releasing a new plan to achieve equity for the African American community and take us one step closer to making America what it ought to be. Read more: 	False
2020-05-04	1257403121363415040	JoeBiden	Over 1 million cases of COVID-19. Almost 70,000 dead. What is upsetting President Trump? Tough questions from the press.  Cry me a river, Mr. President. 	True
2020-05-04	1257365750479818753	JoeBiden	Make no mistake: We can emerge from this crisis a stronger, better, and fairer nation. It’s within our power — we just need a president and an administration who are up for the task.	False
2020-05-04	1257312776780996608	JoeBiden	I've always believed that we've been at our best when we've acted as one America. This crisis is an opportunity for us to be that nation again. There's not a single thing we cannot accomplish if we do it together.	False
2020-05-04	1257097610135056390	JoeBiden	In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. 	True
2020-05-03	1257077475605176326	JoeBiden	The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad. The lack of preparation, the slow response on testing, the failure to administer the relief in the CARES Act appropriately — all of it stems from Donald Trump’s failures as president. 	True
2020-05-03	1257067640482226177	JoeBiden	This Sunday night, settle in and join labor leader Dolores Huerta, actor John Leguizamo, Secretary Hilda Solis, and Congresswoman Escobar for a #TodosConBiden discussion. Tune in now: 	False
2020-05-03	1257057343038033922	JoeBiden	The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together.	False
2020-05-03	1257038468699566089	JoeBiden	Donald Trump seems to think he can direct funding based on which politicians are nice to him, which states he’s trying to win in November, and which businesses he wants to enrich — all without any accountability. @EWarren and I think that’s unacceptable. 	True
2020-05-03	1257021763390767110	JoeBiden	This #WorldPressFreedomDay, support for an independent press at home and around the world matters more than ever. We must vote Trump out this November and assure that attacks on our free press are never again acceptable — especially not in the White House. 	True
2020-05-03	1257021762602184705	JoeBiden	Trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. He bullies members of the press, instead of taking responsibility for his failures. His efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of reporting violate our core values and threaten our very system of government.	True
2020-05-03	1257021761872449542	JoeBiden	A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. And it’s why Donald Trump’s efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.	True
2020-05-03	1256988891942252552	JoeBiden	The U.S. Postal Service is an essential pillar of American life. We simply cannot let Donald Trump destroy it. 	True
2020-05-03	1256961717432733696	JoeBiden	Over the last few weeks, I worked with our supporters and staff to create a code for our campaign—the principles we’ll live by, reflecting the community we’ve built, the team we aspire to be, and some of my own ‘rules’ as well.  I’m excited to share it:  	False
2020-05-02	1256727670554914818	JoeBiden	This pandemic is bigger than any one individual or country. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the nation and around the world — to solve this crisis.	False
2020-05-02	1256698438831476737	JoeBiden	When I say Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history, this is what I'm talking about.  Monty Bennett should return the tens of millions of dollars he received, and we should give it to the small businesses that need it. 	True
2020-05-02	1256667024912244736	JoeBiden	We left a playbook. He ignored it.  We created an office to prepare for pandemics. He gutted it.  We had CDC officials in China to detect and contain outbreaks. He pulled them out.  Trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is his actions left us unprepared. 	True
2020-05-02	1256653934837538816	JoeBiden	Mi corazón y el de Jill están con Puerto Rico a raíz de los terremotos de hoy. Mientras la isla enfrenta el impacto de este suceso y la pandemia del COVID-19 tenemos que asegurarnos que reciban los recursos y la asistencia que necesitan para recuperarse lo más pronto posible.	False
2020-05-02	1256653431705497601	JoeBiden	My heart and Jill's are with the people of Puerto Rico in the wake of another damaging earthquake. As the island grapples with both the impact of this earthquake and this pandemic, we need to ensure they get the resources and assistance needed to recover as soon as possible.	False
2020-05-02	1256636638144446466	JoeBiden	To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet.  To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding. 	False
2020-05-02	1256598066800611329	JoeBiden	On March 6th, Donald Trump said: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”  It was a lie then, and it's still not true nearly two months later. It's a disgrace, and it's slowing efforts to reopen safely.  This administration needs to act immediately to surge testing nationwide.	True
2020-05-02	1256373587784630278	JoeBiden	When we come together and act as one America, there's not a single thing we cannot accomplish.	False
2020-05-01	1256355216934547456	JoeBiden	No one should have to pay for coronavirus treatment. Period. 	False
2020-05-01	1256306743585370112	JoeBiden	I'll say what Donald Trump won't: The Confederate flag, swastikas, and other symbols of hate that have been used in these protests have no place in America. The president should encourage folks to follow Gov. Whitmer’s public health orders — not sow further discord and division. 	True
2020-05-01	1256287268962254852	JoeBiden	As we mark the beginning of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, @DrBiden and I extend our best wishes to AANHPI communities across America. We look forward to celebrating your extraordinary accomplishments and contributions in the month ahead.	False
2020-05-01	1256282238393565184	JoeBiden	When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were before. We have to build a better future for all.  We can and will transform this nation — together.	False
2020-05-01	1256240712036712453	JoeBiden	This crisis isn't about you, Mr. President. It's about the American people. 	False
2020-05-01	1256206136979738624	JoeBiden	We have lived long enough with a President who doesn’t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That’s not me. As a Presidential candidate, I’m accountable to the American people. 	False
2020-05-01	1256036868967280643	JoeBiden	We need a president who listens. 	False
2020-05-01	1256025544346517504	JoeBiden	We need more tests. Our front line workers need protective equipment. Americans need additional economic relief.  Yet the Trump Administration is spending time and energy on President Trump's wasteful border wall.  Unbelievable. 	True
2020-05-01	1256018159997464578	JoeBiden	The number is overwhelming, but each one represents a life thrown into uncertainty, a family unable to make ends meet, and a community worried about how it will recover.  We have to do more to help them. Now. 	False
2020-05-01	1256010445745344512	JoeBiden	- More than 60,000 people in the U.S. have died - 30 million have filed for unemployment - At least 1 million have gotten sick  Enough with the late night Twitter tantrums, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up and lead.	False
2020-04-30	1255988550522351620	JoeBiden	Instead of preparing our country to fight COVID-19, Donald Trump wasted months and promised it would miraculously go away by April.  He was wrong. And we're all paying the price. 	True
2020-04-30	1255962665903697920	JoeBiden	An open and independent press is more important than ever in times like this. They deserve to be treated with respect — not belittled with schoolyard taunts from this president. 	False
2020-04-30	1255939345497849860	JoeBiden	Donald Trump either read his daily briefings and ignored the warnings, or didn't read them at all. Either way, it's a complete and unjustifiable dereliction of duty. 	True
2020-04-30	1255927332768034819	JoeBiden	I’ve been a big fan of Megan’s for years and can’t wait to join her this afternoon. You can watch our chat live at 2:45 PM ET:  	False
2020-04-30	1255904752199536646	JoeBiden	We may be physically apart, but we are all in this together. 	False
2020-04-30	1255884615744516097	JoeBiden	As president, I promise you I'll honor all those we've lost from COVID-19. 	False
2020-04-30	1255863198156304385	JoeBiden	The climate emergency isn't just a threat to our environment, it's a threat to our health, economy, and so much more. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take action to combat it before it's too late. 	True
2020-04-30	1255670706463006731	JoeBiden	In the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is still working to gut the Affordable Care Act and rip health care away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.  They need to drop the lawsuit immediately. 	True
2020-04-30	1255659381565214723	JoeBiden	With rent due in a few days and folks across the country worried they won't be able to make their payments, it's clear more needs to be done to provide relief. We need to freeze rent immediately for people who have lost their jobs and place a temporary ban on evictions.	False
2020-04-29	1255647805118377985	JoeBiden	The words of a president matter — and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19, pass blame onto others, and mislead the American people. I will do the opposite. 	True
2020-04-29	1255636983793082370	JoeBiden	The Trump Admin failed to provide enough testing, PPE, and safety enforcement. Workers have gotten sick, plants have closed, and the meat supply is at risk. It's past time workers have the protections they need to stay healthy and do their job safely. 	True
2020-04-29	1255609049867051015	JoeBiden	"""I wish he were president right now, but I can't wait until he is if all of us do our part to support the kind of person that we want back in the White House."" — @HillaryClinton  Join us:  "	False
2020-04-29	1255581619160784897	JoeBiden	Wear a mask in public. Read your daily briefings. Listen to the experts.  This really isn't rocket science. It's common sense.	False
2020-04-29	1255556201653219328	JoeBiden	Throughout our history, we have emerged from every crisis stronger than before — and we will again.	False
2020-04-29	1255528519670652928	JoeBiden	We owe a profound debt of gratitude to the health care workers on the front lines of this fight. I checked in with Monica, an ICU Nurse, to talk about how she's getting through this and to thank her for all she's doing: 	False
2020-04-29	1255493286988406784	JoeBiden	I couldn't agree with @HillaryClinton more. We need a president who will listen to the science, bring us together, and lead with compassion and heart. If I have the honor of being elected, that's the exact kind of president I will be. 	False
2020-04-29	1255297119457607681	JoeBiden	There are nearly 330 million people in the United States — and according to the Trump White House, we've only conducted 5.4 million COVID-19 tests. It's abysmal.  Donald Trump needs to scale up testing, and he needs to do it immediately.	True
2020-04-29	1255285668911230981	JoeBiden	Let me be very clear: No one is expendable.  We shouldn’t allow rationing of health care that discriminates based on age or disability.	False
2020-04-28	1255253079798222848	JoeBiden	The fact is there has been so much unnecessary death in this country. If we had listened to the experts and heeded their warnings, it could have been stopped short. But Donald Trump failed to act — and now the American people are paying the price. 	True
2020-04-28	1255233827657654277	JoeBiden	I’ve known @HillaryClinton for years, and know that her dedication and passion for bettering our country are second to none. I’m grateful for her endorsement and for her friendship — and look forward to working alongside her to get Donald Trump out of the White House. 	True
2020-04-28	1255211518167142400	JoeBiden	COVID-19 is affecting the entire nation, but the impact doesn’t look the same for everyone. I'm hosting a town hall on how COVID-19 is impacting women — and I'll be joined by special guest Hillary Clinton. Tune in now to watch: 	False
2020-04-28	1255183652943773697	JoeBiden	If you're excited too, join us at 3 PM ET: 	False
2020-04-28	1255183480859824129	JoeBiden	(I'm with her.) 	False
2020-04-28	1255174436363268097	JoeBiden	We're months into this crisis and workers still don't have enough protective equipment, there still aren't enough tests, and the death toll continues to rise.  The President should spend less time congratulating himself and more time doing his job. 	False
2020-04-28	1255140965444182016	JoeBiden	We are months into this crisis, and health care workers still don’t have the protective equipment they need. It’s a national disgrace. 	False
2020-04-28	1254940897130811393	JoeBiden	Tomorrow afternoon, I'll be hosting a town hall on how COVID-19 is impacting women — and I'll be joined by a special guest. Tune in at 3 PM ET to watch:  	False
2020-04-28	1254924567971274752	JoeBiden	The Trump Administration could have helped prevent this. But once again, they failed to take action — and now the American people are paying the price. 	True
2020-04-27	1254900631787245571	JoeBiden	Testing is the springboard we need to help get our economy safely up and running again. Trump could rapidly scale it up. He hasn’t. Instead, he’s passed blame and pushed sole responsibility to governors.  We've got to do better. 	True
2020-04-27	1254875960744255488	JoeBiden	COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together as one America — not by targeting others.  Thank you for helping lead this fight, @AndrewYang. 	False
2020-04-27	1254857452656267264	JoeBiden	Join Senator Kamala Harris and Symone Sanders for a town hall addressing the impact and disparities of COVID-19 in the Black community. Tune in now: 	False
2020-04-27	1254806260324749315	JoeBiden	COVID-19 can hit anyone, anywhere — but it doesn’t affect every community equally. This afternoon, join Senator @KamalaHarris and @SymoneDSanders for a discussion on its disproportionate impact on communities of color.  Tune in at 3:30 PM ET:  	False
2020-04-27	1254782856074637319	JoeBiden	We want our country to get moving and healthy again. But we must take the necessary, rational steps, grounded in science, to do so safely, so COVID-19 doesn’t come roaring back. 	False
2020-04-27	1254756132746379266	JoeBiden	I'm incredibly honored by @SpeakerPelosi's endorsement and grateful for her historic leadership in Congress.   Together, we helped pass Obamacare and together we can not only bring this country back from the brink from this current crisis, but transform it. 	False
2020-04-27	1254560894576623616	JoeBiden	America has always met every big challenge with an even bigger solution — this moment should be no different. We need an infrastructure program that will combat climate change and create good-paying jobs at the same time.	False
2020-04-26	1254538243996921856	JoeBiden	Wealthy firms with ties to Trump got millions, while countless small businesses were turned away. No wonder he wanted no one to watch how the money was deployed.  The American people deserve rigorous oversight — and small businesses deserve relief. Now. 	True
2020-04-26	1254518111430197250	JoeBiden	The American people are stepping up and rising to meet this moment. It's time for our president to do the same.	False
2020-04-26	1254496720454512641	JoeBiden	Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction. 	False
2020-04-26	1254465766444789760	JoeBiden	Imagine the future we can build with Donald Trump out of the White House.

2020-04-26	1254429527700275200	JoeBiden	The workers on the front lines of this crisis are risking their lives every day to combat COVID-19 and keep this country running. The least we can do is provide them the pay and protection they need and deserve. 	False
2020-04-26	1254238015775363072	JoeBiden	366 days ago, we launched this campaign.  192 days from now, we’ll beat Donald Trump.  Let’s go win this thing, together. 	True
2020-04-25	1254197275242496006	JoeBiden	@carobrissett @pizzahut I bet this made their day. Thank you for stepping up and doing what you can to help those on the front lines of this fight.	False

2020-04-25	1254172771753627652	JoeBiden	It’s stories like these that make me so proud to be an American and make me confident that we will overcome this. Because there’s nothing the American people have been unable to accomplish when we do it together.	False
2020-04-25	1254172770830888960	JoeBiden	After seeing the shortage of masks around the country, Marilyn decided to step up and organize efforts in Northern Virginia to make homemade masks. Because of her selfless work, countless front line workers have the masks they need to stay safe.	False
2020-04-25	1254172769882865670	JoeBiden	Older adults are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Recognizing that, Erica decided to organize youth in her community to buy groceries for seniors — ensuring they receive the food they need while staying safe at home. She's a true hero.	False
2020-04-25	1254172769065021441	JoeBiden	Brien usually works at the Ford Plant in Rawsonville, Michigan, driving a semi. But when the plant started assembling much-needed ventilators, he courageously stepped up and volunteered to help. His selfless actions will no doubt save countless lives.	False
2020-04-25	1254172768192598016	JoeBiden	John, a Facilities Maintainer from Staten Island, recently contracted and survived the coronavirus. Shortly after he recovered, a colleague contracted the virus and needed plasma to battle it. John heroically stepped up and donated his plasma to help his coworker.	False
2020-04-25	1254172767194316803	JoeBiden	Across the country, people are stepping up and doing incredible things amid this pandemic. It’s who we are as Americans—in times of crisis, we stand as one.

2020-04-23	1253458882325667840	JoeBiden	Donald Trump will always put his wealthy and well-connected friends first — that should come as no surprise. But to allow the banks to do it on the backs of small business owners in the middle of a global pandemic is a new low — even for him. 	True

2020-04-20	1252347558988525568	JoeBiden	The office of the presidency comes with the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Every great president throughout our history has met that duty with the leadership it demands. Donald Trump has not. 	True
2020-04-20	1252334221361848320	JoeBiden	Like many families, we have had to find new ways to stay connected while we're physically apart. We've been video chatting with our grandchildren a lot and decided to record one to share with you all. Take a look: 	False

2020-04-20	1252280869739548673	JoeBiden	We have to come together to make Donald Trump a one-term president. Once we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we will transform it and create a better future for all.	True

2020-04-19	1251888534627082243	JoeBiden	At a time when studies are linking air pollution with COVID-19 mortality rates for the most vulnerable in our society, the Trump Administration is rolling back environmental protections — allowing more poison into our air. 	True
2020-04-19	1251674691431018496	JoeBiden	As Kierkegaard said, “faith sees best in the dark.” I've always believed that.

2020-04-19	1251661920962326530	JoeBiden	The United States should be standing up for freedom and standing with the people of Hong Kong. Instead, Trump has said he's “standing with Xi Jinping.” That's weak. We need to be strong on values when it comes to China. That's what I'll do as president. 	True

2020-04-18	1251518345548935169	JoeBiden	Donald Trump may not like it, but it's his responsibility to step up and lead our nation's testing strategy. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and returning to some semblance of normalcy. 	True
2020-04-17	1251298144089976832	JoeBiden	Donald Trump continues to do the exact thing we teach our kids not to do: blame others. It’s always somebody else's fault — never his. It’s unbelievable.  We deserve better from our commander in chief. 	True
2020-04-17	1251274236808790017	JoeBiden	Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for our slow, uncoordinated response.

2020-04-17	1251224408959651840	JoeBiden	President Trump is trying to rewrite history when it comes to China and COVID-19 — but the facts don't back him up. Tony Blinken was the Deputy Secretary of State and is one of my top foreign policy advisors. He'll explain. 	True
2020-04-17	1251209309284859904	JoeBiden	The uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left America exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic.

2020-04-16	1250585970396794880	JoeBiden	We won’t defeat this President by being like him. We’ll win by doing the opposite. Where he seeks to divide us, we’ll connect people. Where he shows cruelty, we’ll show compassion. And when he fights, we’ll fight harder. But we can’t do it without you.	False
2020-04-16	1250585969520259074	JoeBiden	Mayor @PeteButtigieg’s campaign had a set of “rules of the road” that helped define the character of his campaign and his supporters. I think it’s a good idea, and one I’d like @TeamJoe to adopt.	False

2020-04-14	1249866208905580547	JoeBiden	I am grateful to have the support of so many Wisconsinites and proud of the courage and commitment folks showed during last week's primary — but it should never have come to that.

2020-04-12	1249434614768132097	JoeBiden	To everyone on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19, thank you. We truly couldn't get through this without you.	False
2020-04-12	1249395607757873154	JoeBiden	As we prepare to reopen America, we have to remember what this crisis has taught us: The administration’s failure to plan, to prepare, to honestly assess and communicate the threat to the nation led to catastrophic results. We cannot repeat those mistakes. 	False

2020-04-12	1249125201536856066	JoeBiden	We are in the middle of a global pandemic — and people need access to health care now more than ever. Donald Trump should reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately.	True
2020-04-11	1249094876366503938	JoeBiden	This new enemy may be unseen, but we have the tools, the expertise, the will, and the spirit to defeat it. There is nothing the American people can't accomplish if we work together.	False
2020-04-11	1249064929182662656	JoeBiden	We need to help as many working families and small businesses as possible.

2020-04-11	1249034481698144256	JoeBiden	We are months into this crisis and our heroes on the front lines still don't have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. It's unconscionable.  Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act immediately. 	True

2020-04-10	1248740039007309826	JoeBiden	No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a global pandemic. We need to freeze rent for people who lose their jobs and place a ban on evictions immediately. 	False

2020-04-09	1248385231356219396	JoeBiden	The devastating unemployment numbers have made one thing even clearer: We need a fourth coronavirus relief package, and we need it fast.

2020-04-09	1248379915382059011	JoeBiden	This morning's news of another rise in unemployment claims—on top of the millions already filed—is devastating.

2020-04-09	1248346736868970497	JoeBiden	I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be expanding the number of testing sites and surging the number of tests — not reducing them. Testing is key to finding a way out of this crisis. 	False

2020-04-08	1247990096957190146	JoeBiden	The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but the slow and chaotic response to it is. He's the commander in chief — it's time he steps up, takes responsibility, and does his job. 	True

2020-04-08	1247920854903767045	JoeBiden	We know how hard this is. You have put the interest of the nation – and the need to defeat Donald Trump – above all else. And for that we’re grateful. But we want you to know: we’ll be reaching out. You’ll be heard by me. As you say: Not me, Us.	True
2020-04-08	1247920853410615296	JoeBiden	To Bernie and Jane, as friends, from Jill and me: You haven’t just run a political campaign; you’ve created a movement.

2020-04-08	1247920466603528193	JoeBiden	I know Bernie well. He’s a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. And it’s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. So I won’t try to. 	False

2020-04-08	1247891970912993280	JoeBiden	It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need. Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act to deliver these life-saving supplies. 	True
2020-04-08	1247699431442370561	JoeBiden	We’re starting to see evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution—which disproportionately affects communities of color &amp; low-income communities—is linked to COVID-19 death rates. It's past time we treat pollution like the threat to our health it is. 	False
2020-04-08	1247681815218753538	JoeBiden	The weeks ahead will be some of the toughest we’ve ever experienced as a nation. We need to face them with the same spirit and resolve that have guided us through previous crises. Because out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again.	False
2020-04-08	1247676278938853376	JoeBiden	Folks, I know these are tough times, but this crisis has made it clearer than ever how much elections matter — and what a difference it makes who is in the White House. If you can, please chip in to fuel our campaign. I would really appreciate it.  	False

False
2020-04-07	1247654894187790337	JoeBiden	On #WorldHealthDay, we thank the tireless health care workers fighting COVID-19, and we see clearly why protecting the health of Americans requires U.S. global leadership—to coordinate an international response, strengthen health systems everywhere, and prevent the next pandemic.	False
2020-04-07	1247626527489044481	JoeBiden	Secretary Modly's resignation is appropriate and called for. His disparaging remarks were far beneath the dignity of the office he held. Our sailors, our nation, and Captain Crozier deserve better. 	False

2020-04-06	1247186048859295745	JoeBiden	It is close to criminal the way they’re dealing with Captain Crozier. He spoke up to protect his sailors — he should have a commendation, not be fired. 	False

2020-04-05	1246867701869490182	JoeBiden	We all want to protect our families — the first step is arming ourselves with the facts.   @DrBiden and I hosted a town hall on COVID-19 with three family YouTubers: ItsJudysLife, J House Vlogs and The Curly Coopers. Tune in tonight at 7PM EDT:  	False
2020-04-05	1246839674724855810	JoeBiden	We are at war with this virus — and the health care workers on the front lines are our soldiers. It is unacceptable that they don’t have the lifesaving masks, gowns, and protective gear they need. 	False

2020-04-04	1246496098614743040	JoeBiden	We owe so much to those working around the clock to keep our country running during this crisis. The least we can do is provide the pay, benefits, and protections they need and deserve. 	False

2020-04-04	1246225973797883904	JoeBiden	My friend, @GabbyGiffords, knows what it takes to persevere in the face of uncertainty. Take a few minutes to read these powerful words from her on how we can get through this — together. 	False
2020-04-03	1246211524747722754	JoeBiden	This is a headline every American should see: “Trump administration ended pandemic early-warning program to detect coronaviruses”  Donald Trump’s shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared to deal with this outbreak. 	True
2020-04-03	1246180453465370624	JoeBiden	Those are the kinds of questions Trump will be responsible for.

Too many lives are at stake.	True
2020-04-03	1246180451863101441	JoeBiden	The CARES Act provides money to help working people—how do we make sure it gets to them as quickly as possible?

2020-04-03	1246128672844718080	JoeBiden	Captain Crozier was faithful to his duty—both to his sailors and his country. Navy leadership sent a chilling message about speaking truth to power. The poor judgment here belongs to the Trump Admin, not a courageous officer trying to protect his sailors. 	True
2020-04-03	1246119929809641472	JoeBiden	This is another clear warning sign that more needs to be done to keep as many people on payroll as possible.

2020-04-02	1245824577516613636	JoeBiden	In order for our government to work for all Americans, it's important it be representative of all Americans.

2020-04-01	1245497925167448065	JoeBiden	At a time when Americans might need health care the most, the Trump Administration is preventing people who need insurance from getting it. Their cruelty truly knows no bounds. 	True

2020-03-27	1243594531611828226	JoeBiden	Patients need ventilators.  Nurses need equipment.  And Donald Trump is attacking people who dare to do something about it.   I thank God every day for people like @GovWhitmer, who are doing the work he won’t. 	True
2020-03-27	1243575004702208000	JoeBiden	The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but his inept response is.

It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.	True
2020-03-27	1243533113625542657	JoeBiden	It’s never a matter of if another pandemic will happen, it’s just a matter of when — and it’s the president’s job to ensure we’re ready.  Donald Trump's careless, shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared and now Americans are paying the price. 	True
2020-03-27	1243349519179317249	JoeBiden	The relief bill passed by Congress was a good start, but now we need to:  - Forgive at least $10,000 of student loan debt per person - Provide emergency paid sick leave to everyone who needs it - Ensure no one has to pay for COVID-19 treatment or an eventual vaccine	False

2020-03-27	1243329134341783564	JoeBiden	President Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because he didn’t do his job when it mattered. 	True

2020-03-26	1243286275274178560	JoeBiden	We've gotta act now to keep the doors open for small businesses on Main Street.  It's simple: The government provides the guarantees; the banks have to move the loans out fast.  If they won't, we need a financial version of the Defense Production Act to make it happen. 	False
2020-03-26	1243266475965775881	JoeBiden	If I were President, here's what I would do right now:  - Use all available authorities to turn the tide on this epidemic - Launch a task force to ensure money rapidly gets to people who need it - Bring leaders of Congress together to build the next deal 	False

2020-03-26	1243208171419774976	JoeBiden	Across the country, ordinary people are stepping up and doing extraordinary things — folks like Isaac and Stephanie, who are creating supplies for their local hospitals.

2020-03-26	1243182920912822272	JoeBiden	The Senate passed a major economic relief package late last night. It's a very important step, but the key is how it will be executed. If I were President, here's how I'd make it work: 	False

2020-03-24	1242594795723173894	JoeBiden	President Trump says no one saw this coming, but that’s just not true. Our own intelligence officials were warning of the coronavirus threat back in January. Trump ignored them, and now we’re paying the price. 	True

2020-03-24	1242521059850510341	JoeBiden	The stakes in this election couldn’t be higher. Donald Trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation — and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks. We have to vote him out of the White House.	True

2020-03-24	1242461164975591429	JoeBiden	I know we are up to this challenge. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together.	False
2020-03-24	1242266351084998656	JoeBiden	As this public health crisis rages, with the economy in peril, and with front line workers putting their lives at risk — Trump and Republican Attorneys-General are attempting to strip health insurance away from millions.

2020-03-24	1242240964288286721	JoeBiden	In January, Donald Trump claimed the coronavirus was “totally under control.”  In February, he said it would disappear.

2020-03-23	1242227794089779201	JoeBiden	Across the country, there are incredible stories of folks stepping up to help their neighbors, stories like this one. It's who we are as Americans.

2020-03-23	1242176036390842368	JoeBiden	Obamacare was a big deal — and that still holds true a decade later. On its tenth anniversary, we need to double down on our efforts to protect it from Donald Trump's attacks and build on it to ensure every American receives the care they need. 	True
2020-03-23	1242166298714476550	JoeBiden	A $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions is unacceptable.

2020-03-23	1242128161657229313	JoeBiden	What is President Trump waiting for?   Health care workers don't have enough masks to keep themselves safe.

2020-03-23	1242091730872107013	JoeBiden	President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put a corporate bailout ahead of families. It's simply wrong. We need to be focused on helping hardworking Americans, communities, and small businesses — not handing big corporations a blank check. 	True
2020-03-23	1241904225396891649	JoeBiden	It’s simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. And it’s wrong. Hardworking, struggling Americans should come first — not the big corporations looking for a blank check. 	True
2020-03-23	1241884112778035200	JoeBiden	President Trump’s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history.  	True

2020-03-22	1241869419988619265	JoeBiden	We should also increase monthly Social Security checks by $200/month, as proposed by Senator Wyden and colleagues. Seniors and people with disabilities are uniquely at risk right now.	False

2020-03-22	1241843344034103301	JoeBiden	On March 6th, Donald Trump claimed: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”  That was a flat-out lie then, and it’s still not true today. It’s a disgrace.  We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. Period.	True
2020-03-22	1241813347206672384	JoeBiden	No bill should pass without immediate, generous relief for workers who are losing jobs and hours, small businesses losing revenue, and communities facing emergency needs.	False
2020-03-22	1241813346174844929	JoeBiden	No bill should pass without conditions on corporations to ensure the help they get goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No blank checks.	False
2020-03-22	1241813344610328576	JoeBiden	It's simple: The White House and @senatemajldr have tried to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. 	False
2020-03-22	1241800059186040835	JoeBiden	We owe a debt of gratitude to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, transportation workers, public safety officials, and everyone working around the clock to keep our country running. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’re doing.	False
2020-03-22	1241772947066544135	JoeBiden	Mr. President — stop lying and start acting. Use the full extent of your authorities, now, to ensure that we are producing all essential goods and delivering them where they need to go. 	False
2020-03-22	1241745449209352193	JoeBiden	In times of crisis, a president should calm and heal, lead the way with a steady hand, and provide a beacon of hope for the American people.  Donald Trump is incapable of doing that. 	True
2020-03-21	1241492280709537793	JoeBiden	We need action, not more empty words from President Trump. It’s time for him to step up and do his job. 	True

2020-03-21	1241416531684331526	JoeBiden	Everyone knows that we're facing a real crisis from the coronavirus. But do you know how we got here and what we need to do next? Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks it down for us: 	False
2020-03-21	1241406213864280064	JoeBiden	The coronavirus test should be made widely available and free.  The coronavirus vaccine, when ready, should be made widely available and free.  Treatment for coronavirus should be free, too.  We're in a crisis. No one should have to pay for their coronavirus health care costs.	False
2020-03-21	1241387087989026822	JoeBiden	From day one, the goal of our campaign has been to unite the country — and in times of crisis, that goal is more important than ever. If we come together and all do our part, we will overcome this. I promise.	False
2020-03-21	1241170839254568960	JoeBiden	The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response. He’s talking about yesterday rather than where we need to be tomorrow. The president needs to stop talking and start rallying government action with the urgency and ambition this moment demands.	False
2020-03-21	1241170838478520321	JoeBiden	Now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he’s not delivering. People are scared. They're frightened. And their president is just exacerbating their concerns.	False
2020-03-21	1241170837568438273	JoeBiden	In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. For months, he falsely told us we had nothing to worry about while praising China’s response for managing the coronavirus.	True
2020-03-20	1241147005658755072	JoeBiden	If you have a minute, read these stories of folks coming together and helping out their neighbors. They represent who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We look out for each other. And that’s how we’ll get through this — together. 	False
2020-03-20	1241122660148490252	JoeBiden	The President says no one cares about being tested.  Have you or a loved one had trouble getting tested? 	False
2020-03-20	1241104438846259201	JoeBiden	Getting money quickly to families is the right goal, but Senate Republicans are proposing to send significantly lower amounts to low-income families than those with higher incomes. That’s terrible economics &amp; terrible values. We should be targeting help to those who need it most. 	False
2020-03-20	1241077046022787074	JoeBiden	The lack of coronavirus testing in the U.S. is a national disgrace. 	False
2020-03-20	1241027971760025603	JoeBiden	The least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide a $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave, and strong workplace protections.	False

2020-03-20	1240998489498288129	JoeBiden	I am calling on every CEO in America to publicly commit now to not buying back their company's stock over the course of the next year. As workers face the physical and economic consequences of the coronavirus, our corporate leaders cannot cede responsibility for their employees.	False
2020-03-20	1240808170651619329	JoeBiden	.@SenGillibrand has never been afraid to speak without fear, to be brave in the face of injustice, and to empower others to get off the sidelines. I'm thrilled and honored to have her support. 	False
2020-03-20	1240798575468175364	JoeBiden	The words of a president matter, and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19 and mislead the American people. He is unfit to lead us through this crisis. 	True
2020-03-19	1240778927431352325	JoeBiden	This administration is truly morally bankrupt. 	False
2020-03-19	1240761659888672769	JoeBiden	Every worker on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 deserves protections and accommodations that keep them and their families safe. I'm glad to see states stepping up to support folks — employers must do the same. 	False

2020-03-19	1240690266358480896	JoeBiden	Doctors and nurses are making their own makeshift face masks today as they risk their lives to care for others. What other finding do you need to see to convince you to use every power you have to expand our supply of essential equipment, Mr. President?	False
2020-03-19	1240690264357793792	JoeBiden	Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it. The President should exercise these powers now. We need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. We need action, not words.	True
2020-03-19	1240675649968168960	JoeBiden	.@TulsiGabbard has put her life on the line in service of this country and continues to serve with honor today. I’m grateful to have her support and look forward to working with her to restore honor and decency to the White House.	False
2020-03-19	1240670113713528833	JoeBiden	This is a moment to look out for our neighbors, care for the elderly, and thank the workers on the front lines of this fight. This is a moment to believe in one another.  When we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we’ll lift this nation up and get through this together.	False
2020-03-19	1240646710021537792	JoeBiden	The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19.  Donald Trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price.	True

2020-03-18	1240378693379293195	JoeBiden	I know the American people have the capacity to meet this moment. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish if we do it together.	False

2020-03-18	1240343464405086209	JoeBiden	Much has been made of changes in President Trump's tone in recent days. But with our health care system at risk, a virus spreading, our economy on the brink — and so many lives at stake — it’s time to be less interested in his words and more focused on his actions — or inaction. 	True
2020-03-18	1240318546896228353	JoeBiden	In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. Volunteers raise their hands to help. Neighbors look out for neighbors. Businesses take care of their workers. That's who we are.  We can and will meet this challenge — together. 	False
2020-03-18	1240280546699366401	JoeBiden	The next president will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize our country and our allies to rapidly meet new challenges — like future pandemics.  We need a leader who will be ready on day one. 	False

2020-03-17	1239932555333373960	JoeBiden	Michigan’s response has far outpaced the federal government’s in this crisis. Gov. Whitmer is leading decisively, while you are live-tweeting her appearances on cable news.  We need a president who will do their job and lead this country. 	False

True
2020-03-16	1239653917740466179	JoeBiden	The coronavirus pandemic is bigger than any one individual. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the country and around the world — to solve this crisis. 	False

2020-03-16	1239360027372204033	JoeBiden	Bernie Sanders voted against comprehensive immigration reform — and then went on TV with Lou Dobbs to brag about it.  Immigrants don't take our jobs. They create jobs. And we need a President who believes that to his or her core. #DemDebate 	False

2020-03-16	1239353172835082240	JoeBiden	Senator @BernieSanders' attacks on my record on Social Security are a bunch of malarkey — and @PolitiFact agrees.  We should be focused on going after Donald Trump — not fellow Democrats. #DemDebate 	True
2020-03-16	1239352291448233984	JoeBiden	All those people Bernie says he cares about would have been in deep trouble without the bailout in 2008/2009. It was about saving the economy — and I agree with Bernie, some bank executives should have gone to jail. #DemDebate	False

2020-03-14	1238875185773772802	JoeBiden	The White House is no place for on-the-job training — Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus has made that even more clear. We need a president who is ready to clean up his mess, take responsibility, and lead us forward on day one.	True

2020-03-02	1234624024438878208	JoeBiden	Bernie Sanders has gone after nearly every corporation in the world — except the gun manufacturers. It's unacceptable. We need a president with the courage to take them on and ensure they can be held accountable for the carnage they have caused. 	False

2020-02-28	1233460356749680640	JoeBiden	My dad always said, “Champ, when you get knocked down, you get back up.” I’ve been knocked down a lot in my life, like so many Americans have, but always get back up.

2020-02-27	1233128772045561856	JoeBiden	One year later, @senatemajldr is still stonewalling the bipartisan universal background check bill. It’s unbelievable. It’s time for Mitch McConnell to stand up to the @NRA, do his job, and bring the bill up for a vote. Lives depend on it. 	False
2020-02-27	1233102732715872256	JoeBiden	Folks, thanks to you we raised $1.2M from nearly 30,000 donors yesterday. And I was even happier to hear that 1/3rd of those donors were new.

2020-02-27	1233093187427684353	JoeBiden	Senator Sanders still hasn’t been honest about how much Medicare for All will cost and who will pay for it. The American people deserve the truth. 	False
2020-02-27	1233066762968559616	JoeBiden	A $15 an hour minimum wage is long overdue, but it’s just the start. We have to make sure every single worker receives the pay and dignity they deserve.	False

2020-02-27	1232859648195063809	JoeBiden	If I were president today, I would not be taking China's word when it comes to the coronavirus. American scientists and health experts should be allowed in the country to determine how the virus started and to help contain its spread. 	False

2020-02-27	1232851279162073089	JoeBiden	I taught constitutional law for a long time and here's the deal: No amendment is absolute. There are limits.  Common-sense reforms like background checks and a ban on assault weapons are not a violation of the Second Amendment. Period.	False

2020-02-27	1232821727002013702	JoeBiden	I'm glad this bill — overdue now for more than a century — has passed.

2020-02-26	1232796201029906433	JoeBiden	I’m a union guy and always have been. I stand with @UFCW — and as president, I’ll invest in American workers.  We need to protect good American jobs and make sure our economy works for all Americans. 	False

2020-02-25	1232393895297912835	JoeBiden	This moment requires strong American leadership and disciplined diplomacy to lead a global response grounded in science — Donald Trump is incapable of that. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency. 	True

2020-02-02	1224005306721677314	JoeBiden	The Iowa caucus is tomorrow night, it’s time to make your plan! Caucusing is fun and easy — and making a plan only takes a few minutes. Head to  to make sure you’re all set. 	False
2020-02-02	1223807268703043588	JoeBiden	Trump further diminished the U.S. in the eyes of the world by expanding his travel ban. This new “African Ban,” is designed to make it harder for black and brown people to immigrate to the United States. It’s a disgrace, and we cannot let him succeed. 	True
2020-02-02	1223774515320193025	JoeBiden	America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, and fairness—we've never fully lived up to them, but we've never stopped trying.

2020-02-01	1223747858316386306	JoeBiden	Health care is on the ballot. We need to protect Obamacare from Donald Trump’s relentless attempts to repeal and sabotage it — and build on the law to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable care. 	True
2020-02-01	1223727977361338370	JoeBiden	We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.	True

2020-02-01	1223693751740010496	JoeBiden	From my childhood in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to the halls of the White House — the middle-class values of hard work, respect, and decency have guided my entire life. It's time we brought those values back to the Oval Office. 	False
2020-02-01	1223669844211458048	JoeBiden	The Iowa Caucus is just days away and polls show us in a dead heat.

2020-01-31	1223390503527469056	JoeBiden	America's character is on the ballot. We can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but if given eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We can't let that happen. 	True
2020-01-31	1223375404351787008	JoeBiden	Donald Trump's Muslim ban is a direct betrayal of America’s most fundamental freedom: religious freedom. And now he's adding more countries to his list of who's not welcome in America.  It's not who we are — and we'll prove that when we beat Trump this November and end the ban. 	True
2020-01-31	1223351496877793280	JoeBiden	I've stood up to bullies my entire life, and I'm ready to stand up to the one in the White House. I hope President Trump heard that message loud and clear when he saw this ad air during Fox &amp; Friends this morning. 	True
2020-01-31	1223323814290870272	JoeBiden	Time and time again, Donald Trump has proven he has no moral rudder. Instead of having respect for others, he insults and demeans. He preys on divisions and stokes hate, instead of healing and uniting.  Trump is everything we aspire not to be as Americans.	True
2020-01-31	1223299854849445888	JoeBiden	.@JohnDelaney ran his campaign with conviction to make our government work for the American people. He will continue to be an important voice in shaping our country for years to come. 	False
2020-01-31	1223286098052485121	JoeBiden	Let's be clear: If Donald Trump can afford to give giant tax breaks to the super-wealthy, then he can afford to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society receive the health care they need and deserve.  We should be expanding Medicaid — not cutting it. 	True
2020-01-31	1223078215301967876	JoeBiden	Airline catering workers will feed thousands of people traveling to the Super Bowl, but can’t afford to feed their own families. I stand in solidarity with @unitehere_sofla. @AmericanAir needs to ensure @LSGSkyChefs pay their workers living wages. 	False

2020-01-30	1223025600459231232	JoeBiden	We can't let Donald Trump define us as a nation — we are so much better than who he thinks we are. Let’s choose to be the more perfect union we've always aspired to be and restore the soul of this nation. 	True

2020-01-30	1222950101724864515	JoeBiden	It’s no understatement to say that Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the future of our country.

2020-01-30	1222926194502447104	JoeBiden	Ending gun violence is on the ballot. We have to take on the powerful gun lobby and pass common-sense measures that will keep our kids safe. I've beaten the @NRA twice — and I'll do it again as president. 	False
2020-01-30	1222724095051214848	JoeBiden	As I’ve said many times, health care is deeply personal to me, like it is for so many Americans. I’m proud to stand with @SEIU1199NW to fight for safe staffing, patient care, and fair pay. 	False
2020-01-30	1222698443463782400	JoeBiden	The true character of a person is revealed in the Oval Office. We saw it with President Obama. We're seeing it with President Trump — and what we've witnessed from this president over the last three years makes clear that we can't give him another four. 	True
2020-01-30	1222691999364657152	JoeBiden	Donald Trump has slammed the door shut in the face of families fleeing persecution and violence. On day one, I will eliminate President Trump’s decision to limit asylum and end the MPP program. #RestoreAsylumNOW 	True
2020-01-30	1222685860497215488	JoeBiden	I've spent my entire life bringing people together to get big, difficult things done. And I intend to do that as your president — unifying our country at the moment we need it most. There’s no limit to what we could do if we come together. 	False
2020-01-29	1222666986317942789	JoeBiden	Equal pay for equal work is common sense — and long overdue. That's why the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that the Obama-Biden Administration signed 11 years ago today.

2020-01-29	1222633013068161025	JoeBiden	The decision to allow the Trump Administration to discriminate against immigrants based on wealth is a cruel betrayal of our values.

2020-01-29	1222346121944715267	JoeBiden	Donald Trump’s demonstrated failures of judgment and his repeated rejection of science make him the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health challenge. 	True
2020-01-29	1222333539049332736	JoeBiden	Imagine all the progress we could make in the next four years. We could make health care a right, lead on climate change, and get assault weapons out of our schools. It could all be a reality — but first, we have to beat Donald Trump. 	True
2020-01-29	1222323147418017794	JoeBiden	A peace plan requires two sides to come together. This is a political stunt that could spark unilateral moves to annex territory and set back peace even more. I've spent a lifetime working to advance the security &amp; survival of a Jewish and democratic Israel. This is not the way. 	False
2020-01-28	1222307450495389696	JoeBiden	Iowans, on Feb. 3rd, you have a chance for a twofer. You can ruin Donald Trump's night, and you can ruin Senator Ernst’s, too. 	True
2020-01-28	1222241683938725888	JoeBiden	Let's remember one thing when it comes to impeachment: Donald Trump is on trial because he's afraid to run against me. He knows I’ll beat him this November.	True

2020-01-28	1222007101389770759	JoeBiden	Iowa caucus-goers take note. Joni Ernst just spilled the beans. She and Donald Trump are scared to death I’ll be the nominee. On Feb. 3rd, let’s make their day. 	True
2020-01-28	1221987724095361024	JoeBiden	No family in search of a better life should be denied permanent residency because they don't meet Donald Trump's wealth test.  The United States of America should be open and welcome to all — not just the wealthy. 	True
2020-01-28	1221954793481990145	JoeBiden	Let's be clear: Donald Trump's Muslim ban was never about safety — it was a blatant ploy to fan the flames of bigotry and score points with his political base. I will end it.	True

2020-01-27	1221890408009084936	JoeBiden	Selling off public services to private interests at the expense of workers and their communities should be a non-starter. Congratulations to the members of @ATUComm, who went on strike for 84 days to fight for their rights — and won. 	False
2020-01-27	1221880050951176192	JoeBiden	Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and we are running out of time to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and rally the world to meet the urgency of this moment. 	True

2020-01-26	1221222865783132160	JoeBiden	The seas are rising. Australia is burning. And in this moment of crisis, our President thinks windmills cause cancer. Solving the climate crisis, starts with beating Donald Trump. And once I do, we'll pass my ambitious climate plan. 	True
2020-01-25	1221213660191739904	JoeBiden	Firefighters represent the best of America — they put their lives on the line every single day and selflessly rush toward danger to save others.  I'm grateful for the endorsement of @IAFFNewsDesk. There's no group of people I'd rather stand with. 	False

2020-01-24	1220813019917111297	JoeBiden	The stakes of this election couldn’t be higher. Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he poses a threat to America and the world. We have to beat him. 	True
2020-01-24	1220769483410702339	JoeBiden	Immigrants have always made our country stronger. Our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does. 	True

2020-01-24	1220529945174298627	JoeBiden	Great news out of Utah. No child should be subjected to the vile, immoral practice of conversion therapy. We have to ban it at the federal level and make sure every young person is affirmed and accepted just as they are. 	False
2020-01-24	1220513043504910337	JoeBiden	I tell people that when a family experiences tragedy, the most important thing they can do is to turn their grief into purpose. @fred_guttenberg found his purpose — and his courage and determination have helped fuel the fight for gun safety reform. 	False
2020-01-23	1220485109209423872	JoeBiden	U.S. troops hurt in Iran's missile attack are being evaluated for traumatic brain injuries. To Trump, it's just “headaches.” We need a president who respects our service members and honors our sacred duty to care for our wounded warriors. 	True
2020-01-23	1220456672017223680	JoeBiden	It’s not hyperbole to say Donald Trump is a threat to our planet. We have to get him out of the White House and treat the climate emergency like the existential threat that it is. Our future depends on it.	True
2020-01-23	1220437294609387520	JoeBiden	On the anniversary of a hopeful moment, it's clear Trump's Venezuela policy is a dead end. Millions are suffering with the Maduro regime still in power. 	True

2020-01-23	1220182792304308225	JoeBiden	When we divert public funds to private schools, we undermine the entire public education system. We've got to prioritize investing in our public schools, so every kid in America gets a fair shot. That's why I oppose vouchers. #Espinoza	False

2020-01-19	1218945416596795393	JoeBiden	I stand with the snow plow drivers who work day in and day out to keep our roads safe, often in dangerous conditions. Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits. Stay safe out there, @IBT_320. 	False
2020-01-19	1218930361402634242	JoeBiden	Thank you @Captsully for sharing your story. There’s a lot of kids who I bet needed to hear it.   Being different isn’t a barrier to success. It can give you the strength to save lives in a crash landing — or even run for President. 	False
2020-01-19	1218684496293384192	JoeBiden	Donald Trump continues to embrace corruption at home and abroad. Rather than addressing the root causes pushing people to flee Central America, he has undermined anti-corruption bodies—first in Guatemala and now in Honduras. 	True
2020-01-18	1218658070512861184	JoeBiden	There used to be a basic bargain in this country—when you worked hard, you shared in the prosperity you helped create. But CEOs and Wall Street continue to put profits over workers. It's wrong.  We have to restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone earns what they deserve.	False
2020-01-18	1218622334929518593	JoeBiden	Together, we're going to beat Donald Trump and take back this country.  Chip in if you’re ready to leave him in the dust:  	True
2020-01-18	1218594149558972416	JoeBiden	Weapons of war have no place in our communities. It’s time we take on the @NRA and ban assault weapons for good.	False
2020-01-18	1218567473768747008	JoeBiden	Vermont — you don't have to wait until March 3rd to cast your ballot, you can early vote now! Head to  to find all the info you need to make your voice heard in the primary. 	False
2020-01-18	1218327140053082114	JoeBiden	Happy birthday, @MichelleObama. You’re a shining light in the lives of all that have the honor of knowing you. Jill and I are grateful to call you a dear friend.  But don’t tell Jill — I’m still eating ice cream. And I’m not sorry. 	False
2020-01-17	1218305723706363913	JoeBiden	We need a president who respects our troops — and who will restore honor and integrity to the Oval Office. 	False
2020-01-17	1218305640042504192	JoeBiden	"Donald Trump says he prefers war heroes who ""weren't captured."" He attacks Gold Star families. Now he calls our generals “losers,"" “babies” and “dopes.""  He degrades the office he holds every day. "	True
2020-01-17	1218294441255014403	JoeBiden	No malarkey here. 	False
2020-01-17	1218285113164824577	JoeBiden	Minnesota — early voting is now open! Don’t wait until March 3rd to cast your ballot, head to the polls and be one of the first in the nation to make your voice heard in the primary.  Find everything you need to know here:  	False
2020-01-17	1218245602623909890	JoeBiden	It is a moral failing when children are ripped from their parents' arms, locked away in overcrowded detention centers, and denied toothbrushes and soap.  We have to end Donald Trump's cruel policies and build a fair and humane immigration system.	True
2020-01-17	1218169872791764994	JoeBiden	This isn't just about who I am, this is about who we are as a country. We're tough, resilient, but always full of hope. With every fiber in my being, I believe there’s not a single thing we can't do—if we do it together. 	False
2020-01-17	1217982368499236864	JoeBiden	Hate never goes away; it just hides. And when leaders give it oxygen — as Donald Trump has done — it comes roaring back. 	True
2020-01-17	1217971138162298881	JoeBiden	America’s farmers have had enough of your empty promises, Mr. President.  	False
2020-01-17	1217962049726226433	JoeBiden	Let's be clear: white supremacy, racism, and violence have no place in America. We have to root out these evils and give hate no safe harbor. If we stand together, we will win the battle for the soul of our nation. 	False
2020-01-16	1217937084876513282	JoeBiden	Voting is a right. 	False
2020-01-16	1217918195115257856	JoeBiden	A president has to be able to not only fight — but heal and bring our country together. I promise you that’s what I will do if I’m elected. 	False
2020-01-16	1217891772862468096	JoeBiden	The character of our nation is on the ballot in this election. We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are — and we have to prove that this November. 	True
2020-01-16	1217864525640278020	JoeBiden	If true, this constitutes an unprecedented attack on our Foreign Service. Amb. Yovanovitch spent her life advancing U.S. interests, only to be defamed by this administration. Our diplomats deserve better. It's inexcusable that Sec. Pompeo won't defend them. 	False
2020-01-16	1217637216937267206	JoeBiden	America has never lived up to our promise of equality for all, but we've never stopped trying. Virginia brought us closer to that highest ideal today by ratifying the long overdue #ERA.  Women's rights should be explicitly in our Constitution—not left to the whims of legislators. 	False
2020-01-16	1217613689068642305	JoeBiden	I'm more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we come together and unite this country, there's not a single thing we can't do. 	False
2020-01-16	1217604963825848320	JoeBiden	My thoughts and prayers are with Mustafa Kassem's family at this difficult time. His death, after six years in an Egyptian jail, is an outrage. Americans unjustly detained anywhere in the world deserve our government’s full support and relentless efforts to secure their release. 	False
2020-01-15	1217583673282789377	JoeBiden	This seems like a great reason to rejoin the Paris Agreement, @realDonaldTrump. 	True
2020-01-15	1217570907176046592	JoeBiden	I’m proud that today, our campaign is launching HBCU Students for Biden. This program will be dedicated to helping HBCU students throughout the country learn how to organize for our campaign.   Sign up here:  	False
2020-01-15	1217546999433744386	JoeBiden	I'm ready to debate Donald Trump on the economy. The American people are getting clobbered, and the wealthy are the only ones doing well. We have to rebuild the middle class, and this time, make sure everyone comes along. 	True
2020-01-15	1217516800369405952	JoeBiden	Cornell is right — everything is at stake this November. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and unite this country. Because if we come together and act as one America, there is nothing that we can't accomplish. 	True
2020-01-15	1217493376267886594	JoeBiden	Historically Black Colleges and Universities have always been the heartbeat of our country’s fight for justice. That’s why I’ll invest $70 billion in HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions.  When HBCUs rise, we all rise—join HBCU Students for Biden today:  	False
2020-01-15	1217321765174759424	JoeBiden	I just got off the debate stage in Iowa, where we're in the homestretch before the caucus. With just 19 days left, every dollar counts.  Chip in if you're ready to take back this country and make Donald Trump a one-term president:  	True
2020-01-15	1217299473128443904	JoeBiden	This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity, if we do it together. Let’s go do it. #DemDebate	False
2020-01-15	1217298932151263232	JoeBiden	With just 20 days until the Iowa Caucus, we need your help to fuel our campaign. Every donation—big or small—goes a long way in this homestretch.  If you liked what you heard at tonight's #DemDebate, please chip in what you can to keep our momentum going: 	False
2020-01-15	1217296167870115841	JoeBiden	Look, I’ve been the object of Donald Trump’s affection now more than anyone else on this stage. I’ve taken all the hits he’s delivered, and I’m only getting stronger in the polls. #DemDebate	True
2020-01-15	1217289913969840130	JoeBiden	Republicans have savaged my only surviving son. They’ve spread lies about me that networks won’t even carry. It doesn’t matter if they go after me.  As President of the United States, I have to be able to not only fight — I have to heal. And that’s what I’ll do if I’m elected.	False
2020-01-15	1217288891625025537	JoeBiden	Child care is personal to me: I was a single parent as a young senator. I commuted home to Delaware every night to tuck my kids into bed. Child care should be affordable for every parent. #DemDebate	False
2020-01-15	1217286036092604417	JoeBiden	Make no mistake, the situation with Iran is a crisis of Donald Trump’s own making. He claimed walking away from the Iran deal would deter Iranian aggression and result in a better deal. He failed on both accounts. 	True
2020-01-15	1217284316973207553	JoeBiden	Under the Biden administration, labor and environmental groups will be at the table to negotiate trade agreements. Period. 	False
2020-01-15	1217281361247178752	JoeBiden	Medicare should be able to negotiate prices with drug companies. #DemDebate	False
2020-01-15	1217280340114448384	JoeBiden	I’ve been very clear about what my health care plan would do: Build on Obamacare by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate. #DemDebate	False
2020-01-15	1217275855401103360	JoeBiden	If we don’t write the global rules of the road for trade, cyber, climate change, and so much more, they may be written by China or other nations that don’t share our values. #DemDebate	False
2020-01-15	1217273974427652097	JoeBiden	I wouldn’t meet with Kim Jong Un without pre-conditions. By meeting with him, Donald Trump gave Kim Jong Un what he was looking for: legitimacy. I will work closely with our allies and hold China accountable for its lack of pressure on the Kim regime’s bad behavior. #DemDebate	True
2020-01-15	1217270827873460226	JoeBiden	No president can take our country to war without the informed consent of the American people. #DemDebate	False
2020-01-15	1217270360443424768	JoeBiden	There’s a big difference between sending tens of thousands of American combat troops to the Middle East indefinitely – which I oppose and will end – and using small teams of special forces to support local forces doing the fighting to advance our common security. #DemDebate	False
2020-01-15	1217269640893734912	JoeBiden	No one should shed a tear for Qassem Soleimani. But Trump’s reckless escalation and thoughtless withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has made America less safe. We need a return to diplomacy and a steady hand at the wheel to navigate an increasingly dangerous world. #DemDebate	True
2020-01-15	1217268959508078592	JoeBiden	When Trump discarded the Iran nuclear deal he promised it would produce a “better” one and curb Iranian aggression—the reverse happened. Iran has restarted its nuclear program and become more provocative. I’ll return to smart, disciplined diplomacy to address the threats we face.	True
2020-01-15	1217267798025568256	JoeBiden	In 2009 President Obama asked me to oversee our effort to bring home our combat troops. I’ll put my record and my judgment up against anyone in terms of who is the right person to be Commander in Chief. #DemDebate	False
2020-01-15	1217261367234711552	JoeBiden	I’m about to step on stage for tonight’s #DemDebate in Iowa. Make sure to follow along here and on @TeamJoe for updates throughout the night, and tune in to @CNN at 9 PM ET to watch live!	False
2020-01-15	1217250530164183040	JoeBiden	So much of what’s tearing this country apart can be fixed if we treat each other with basic dignity and respect once again. That starts with having a president who leads by example. 	False
2020-01-14	1217198381812080643	JoeBiden	Donald Trump has once again sided with corporations over American workers by making it easier for them to get away with wage theft and overtime violations.  It's time we put workers' rights over corporate greed and ensure everyone has the workplace protections they deserve. 	True
2020-01-14	1217145604691771392	JoeBiden	We’re in a battle for the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has:  - Fanned the flames of hatred and bigotry - Embraced dictators - Ripped children from their parents' arms - Degraded our national character  We have to get him out of the White House.	True
2020-01-14	1217091659076337664	JoeBiden	Why are you so obsessed with me, Mr. President? 	False
2020-01-14	1216920521369096192	JoeBiden	I'm married to a teacher, I see firsthand how difficult it is. We've got to let educators do their job so our students can succeed - that means paying them the salaries they deserve and giving them the respect that they've earned. 	False
2020-01-14	1216906004308414465	JoeBiden	From day one, Donald Trump has been determined to roll back every environmental protection he could get his hands on.  At a time when the climate crisis is pushing our planet to the brink, we should strengthen protections — not weaken them. 	True
2020-01-14	1216888913199013889	JoeBiden	The stakes of this election could not be higher. Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of our nation. We can't let that happen.  We have to do everything in our power to make him a one-term president.	True
2020-01-14	1216873556241416193	JoeBiden	"When we said to give us your tired, poor, and huddled masses, we absolutely did not mean ""unless they are fleeing violence."" "	False
2020-01-13	1216842742145462275	JoeBiden	Transit workers are being attacked every day, often while buses are moving, putting bus drivers and riders in harm's way. That's why I strongly support the Transit Worker and Pedestrian Protection Act to protect our workers from harm while doing their job. 	False
2020-01-13	1216818448900263938	JoeBiden	Donald Trump has no strategy when it comes to Iran. No endgame. The only way out of his self-made crisis is through diplomacy — clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that's not about one-off decisions or one-upmanship. 	True
2020-01-13	1216788361198866434	JoeBiden	Come on. Your administration has been arguing in court to repeal protections for people with pre-existing conditions.  You're trying to take health care away from millions of people. The least you could do is be honest about it. 	False
2020-01-13	1216758302421352451	JoeBiden	Cory, you campaigned with joy and heart, and instead of just talking about bringing people together, you did it every day. You made our politics better just by running. Grateful to you and looking forward to your continued leadership.	False
2020-01-13	1216546909579567104	JoeBiden	Puerto Rico should not be treated any differently than if this happened anywhere else in America — it's wrong. We should be surging all the help that is needed to fix the damage done by the earthquakes. 	False
2020-01-12	1216495106037035011	JoeBiden	There’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of Donald Trump. We can:  - Address the climate emergency - Build a more inclusive middle class - Build on Obamacare - Ensure our government works for everyone — not just the powerful	True
2020-01-12	1216464610318061577	JoeBiden	Trump’s reckless policies have needlessly endangered our interests in the Middle East. But none of us should be under any illusions about the Iranian regime, and the Iranian people — like all people everywhere — have the right to peaceful protest. The world should support them.	True
2020-01-12	1216424855257534464	JoeBiden	Gracias por su apoyo, Mayor @EricGarcetti. Estoy orgulloso de caminar junto a los bomberos, los Angelenos, y los Americanos. Y hoy, me siento orgulloso de caminar junto a ti. Vamos. 	False
2020-01-12	1216422087138693120	JoeBiden	Thank you for your endorsement, Mayor @EricGarcetti. I’m proud to walk with firefighters, Angelenos, and Americans. And today, I’m proud to walk with you. Let’s do this. 	False
2020-01-12	1216160510183428096	JoeBiden	I want to congratulate my friend Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller on making history. I've known Tom for years, he has never been afraid to take on the tough fights and has always served with honor and integrity—Iowa and our nation are better because of it. 	False
2020-01-11	1216109024040476672	JoeBiden	I've seen firsthand how hard our educators work for little pay and with few resources. They deserve better. It's time we support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve. 	False
2020-01-11	1216081341965590529	JoeBiden	What kind of nation are we if we simply accept that kids learn active shooter drills with their ABCs? We have to take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reforms to protect our children. 	False
2020-01-11	1216056642313359361	JoeBiden	Congratulations to President Tsai and the people of Taiwan for another successful election. You are stronger because of your free and open society. The United States should continue strengthening our ties with Taiwan and other like-minded democracies. 	False
2020-01-11	1216053407779360768	JoeBiden	Members of Teamsters Local 104 are striking against ASARCO for their unfair labor practices—I called into the picket line to support them. Every company should provide its workers with the pay and benefits they've earned—especially one that pulls in over $1 billion in profits. 	False
2020-01-11	1215808474501844992	JoeBiden	Firefighters represent the best of America — courageous, selfless, and always answering the call to duty. I'm grateful to those who are heading to help our friends in Australia battle devastating wildfires. 	False
2020-01-11	1215786650137055234	JoeBiden	Being a nation of immigrants is and has always been one of our greatest strengths. Our diversity has always made us stronger, but Donald Trump doesn’t get that. 	True
2020-01-10	1215740345113141248	JoeBiden	Make no mistake: the situation with Iran is a crisis of Donald Trump's own making. He brought us to the brink of war with no plan and no strategy.  He is the most erratic and incompetent commander in chief we've ever had. 	True
2020-01-10	1215703603098288129	JoeBiden	I've released 21 years of my tax returns. Why haven't you released any of yours, Mr. President?  Release your taxes or hush up about corruption. 	False
2020-01-10	1215653271961919489	JoeBiden	Donald Trump brought us dangerously close to starting a new war with Iran without any semblance of a plan.  This moment requires a leader who will be ready on day one to pick up the pieces and repair the damage Trump has caused. 	True
2020-01-10	1215457388825923584	JoeBiden	I started the Cancer Moonshot so we could be the generation that finally cures cancer.  You then tried to slash nearly $1 billion for cancer funding.  We're lucky that the cancer rate is down, but we're luckier that Congress stopped you. 	False
2020-01-09	1215393056603561984	JoeBiden	This election is about the soul of America — and a nation that allows our epidemic of school shootings to continue has a troubled soul. We have to beat the @NRA and get weapons of war off our streets. Lives depend on it. 	False
2020-01-09	1215358611024678913	JoeBiden	Facebook continues to put their profits over the truth — allowing politicians like Donald Trump to spend an unthinkable amount of money on paid disinformation. Our democracy is worse off for their failure to confront this. 	True
2020-01-09	1215298432958529537	JoeBiden	We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are. We don’t have to give in to his dark, petty, angry vision of America. We can choose to be the more perfect union we have always aspired to be — and restore the soul of this nation. 	True
2020-01-09	1215082273822953472	JoeBiden	Instead of using his statement today to lay out a coherent strategy on Iran, Donald Trump used it to mislead the country on the Obama-Biden record. He's been President for three years. It's time he stops blaming President Obama for his failures.	True
2020-01-09	1215082272682119170	JoeBiden	I'm thankful no one was hurt in last night's attack. But we're only in this mess because Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal (which even his advisors said was working), turned his back on our allies, and had no strategy for what comes next.	True
2020-01-09	1215069324538499072	JoeBiden	Gabby is one of the strongest people I know. The resilience she has shown is remarkable. I'm inspired by her courage in turning tragedy into purpose and grateful for her relentless determination to make our country a safer place for all. 	False
2020-01-08	1215054324553764864	JoeBiden	3,820 days — that's how long it's been since the federal minimum wage was last raised. It’s unacceptable. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour nationwide should be just our starting point for ensuring workers receive the pay they deserve. 	False
2020-01-08	1215009026125303811	JoeBiden	Pope Francis is absolutely right. As a nation, we have a moral obligation to ensure everyone has access to the care they need. Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few. 	False
2020-01-08	1214980085339623425	JoeBiden	We have to rebuild the middle class. But this time, we have to make sure that people historically left out of the middle class — whether due to race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion — have the chance to be included in our success. 	False
2020-01-08	1214722638733406209	JoeBiden	I’m going to hold off on commenting on the news tonight until we know more, but there is one thing I will say: Jill and I are keeping our troops and Americans overseas in our prayers. We hope you’ll keep them in yours.	False
2020-01-07	1214675579498192898	JoeBiden	Donald Trump says he wants to end endless wars in the Middle East, yet he is bringing us dangerously close to starting a new one. 	True
2020-01-07	1214669387417952258	JoeBiden	Estoy con el pueblo de Puerto Rico, nuestros conciudadanos, en este momento de necesidad. Es inconcebible que gran parte del arduo trabajo de la recuperación ante desastres aún no se haya hecho. Tenemos que ofrecer apoyo concreto a Puerto Rico antes de que se pierdan más vidas. 	False
2020-01-07	1214646310256726016	JoeBiden	I stand with the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow citizens, in this moment of need. It’s unconscionable that so much of the hard work of disaster recovery continues to be left undone. We've got to deliver concrete support for Puerto Rico now before more lives are lost. 	False
2020-01-07	1214641417160724484	JoeBiden	Nicolás Maduro is a dictator. I strongly condemn his regime’s violent takeover of the Venezuelan National Assembly, the country’s sole remaining democratic institution. 	False
2020-01-07	1214627763832807424	JoeBiden	Donald Trump is the most reckless &amp; incompetent commander in chief we've ever had. Every day he directs American national security is a dangerous day for the world.  We have to get him out of the White House. Chip in to help make him a one-term president: 	True
2020-01-07	1214607032113913857	JoeBiden	At 1:00 PM, I'll be speaking about the escalating situation with Iran and the imperative need to restore respected, responsible, and dignified leadership on the world stage. Tune in to watch live: 	False
2020-01-07	1214340404289703936	JoeBiden	Trump wants to ignore climate science when making infrastructure decisions. In the Biden Administration, every dollar spent toward rebuilding our roads, bridges, buildings, the electric grid, and our water infrastructure will be used to reduce and withstand a changing climate. 	True
2020-01-06	1214298343435915264	JoeBiden	On Día de los Reyes, as Christmas comes to a close, we are reminded of the call of the three kings: to give of ourselves without expectation, seek peace no matter how long the journey, and know that a bright future is within reach.

2020-01-06	1214267892482469888	JoeBiden	Let's be clear: Donald Trump does not have the authority to take us into war with Iran without Congressional approval. A president should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people.	True
2020-01-06	1214226912270311425	JoeBiden	John Deere is laying off yet another round of workers in Iowa because of Donald Trump's reckless trade war. All he's succeeded at is taking jobs away from American workers. It has to stop. 	True
2020-01-06	1213987660802465793	JoeBiden	I stand in solidarity with those marching in New York against the rise of anti-Semitism. This is what the battle for the soul of our nation looks like — and it's up to all of us to reject intolerance in all its forms and give hate no safe harbor. 	False
2020-01-06	1213981505443287040	JoeBiden	Our Statue of Liberty invites in the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free.

2020-01-05	1213955345372065792	JoeBiden	This is a crisis of Donald Trump’s own making. He claimed pulling out of the Iran deal would deter Iranian aggression and result in a better deal. He has failed on both counts.  He is the most erratic and incompetent commander in chief we’ve ever had. 	True
2020-01-05	1213908021304332288	JoeBiden	Hey @realDonaldTrump, do you think the American people want another war in the Middle East? Des Moines certainly doesn’t. 	True

2020-01-04	1213606448699232257	JoeBiden	The world is burning, yet Donald Trump continues to deny the evidence of climate change before all of our eyes. We have to get him out of the White House and take urgent global action to combat the climate crisis before it’s too late. 	True
2020-01-04	1213573089910493184	JoeBiden	This simply shouldn’t happen in America. Folks deserve access to affordable, quality long-term care in their homes.   We have to fight for Alex and those who use long-term care. 	False
2020-01-04	1213555699671851015	JoeBiden	We can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but if we give him eight years in the White House he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We can't let that happen. 	True
2020-01-04	1213515434420391937	JoeBiden	On the trail, I hear countless stories from folks whose lives have been changed by Obamacare. We can't afford to start over—we need a president who will protect and build on it to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable care. 	False
2020-01-04	1213265034601611264	JoeBiden	The prospect of direct conflict with Iran is greater than ever. Does Donald Trump have a strategy for what comes next?  Nothing we have seen from this Administration suggests that they are prepared to deal with the risks we now confront. 	True
2020-01-03	1213217722508570624	JoeBiden	We need a leader who will be ready on day one to pick up the pieces of Donald Trump's broken foreign policy and repair the damage he has caused around the world. 	True
2020-01-03	1213131655474376705	JoeBiden	Our world has been set on edge by an erratic, unstable, and dangerously incompetent commander in chief. The stakes could not be higher.

2020-01-03	1212922129886388224	JoeBiden	Donald Trump stacked the Supreme Court with justices to try to overturn Roe v.

2020-01-03	1212908938590670848	JoeBiden	We're just one full day into 2020 and there have already been at least three mass shootings across the country.   Enough is enough. We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic.	False

2020-01-02	1212871441093255168	JoeBiden	If you're a teacher or a firefighter, you're probably paying more in taxes than Amazon or Netflix. We've got to make sure corporations pay their fair share.	False

2020-01-02	1212556035283705858	JoeBiden	Every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House puts the future of our planet at risk. We have to beat him this November and take immediate action to address the climate emergency. 	True
