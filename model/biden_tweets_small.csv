10.9.2020 21.33	JoeBiden	MarkCavitt	2264	9365	26094	Donald Trump is holding a rally in Michigan today—while also refusing to fully fund their National Guard. These are frontline workers against COVID-19, responsible for testing and distributing food and medical supplies. Michiganders need a pandemic response—not a pep rally.				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1304171037240619008

10.9.2020 20.00	JoeBiden		2922	5982	20574	Make no mistake: Climate change is already here — and we’re witnessing its devastating effects every single day. We have to get President Trump out of the White House and treat this crisis like the existential threat that it is.				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1304147637201854464

10.9.2020 15.54	JoeBiden		17440	68566	303899	Donald Trump said he didn't want to tell the truth and create a panic. So he did nothing and created a disaster.				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1304085725009248256	
10.9.2020 13.38	JoeBiden		965	2667	18448	I got to meet Lou Brock back in March. I joked that I had really just come to St. Louis to see him—and let me tell you, our meeting was a real highlight. Lou was a true legend and a man of integrity. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our prayers during this difficult time.				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1304051499358662656	
10.9.2020 1.28	JoeBiden		7466	24983	67429	Donald Trump knew that COVID-19 was dangerous. He knew it was deadly. And he purposely downplayed it. Now, nearly 200,000 Americans are dead. It’s unconscionable.				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1303867788759568384

9.9.2020 22.45	JoeBiden		10471	22170	92895	If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone. Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action — costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin. It’s an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1303826768525131776	
9.9.2020 21.27	JoeBiden		1099	3246	18628	Roberto Clemente was an incredible baseball player. He was a barrier breaker and a humanitarian. As he rose to fame, he lifted the Black and Latino communities with him. I may be a Phillies fan, but I’m always proud to honor the legacy of #21.				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1303807139203493888

9.9.2020 18.07	JoeBiden	washingtonpost	9211	38219	132790	Donald Trump knew. He lied to us for months. And while a deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job — on purpose. It was a life or death betrayal of the American people.				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1303756807895220226

9.9.2020 14.20	JoeBiden		3852	10061	31907	President Obama and I rescued the auto industry and helped Michigan's economy come roaring back. Donald Trump squandered it — and hardworking Michiganders are paying the price every day.				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1303699681420087296	
9.9.2020 0.48	JoeBiden		1221	2753	11992	Given his track record, no one can take Trump’s word alone on a COVID-19 vaccine.

9.9.2020 0.48	JoeBiden		1374	2486	12437	3: What is the plan to allocate and distribute vaccines to Americans cost-free, safely, equitably, and without politics?

9.9.2020 0.48	JoeBiden		546	1828	8802	2: Who will validate that the Administration’s decision to greenlight a COVID-19 vaccine is driven by science and not political motivation? We must hear uncensored statements on efficacy and safety from @FDACBER, the @US_FDA vaccine advisory committee, and Dr. Fauci.		@FDACBER @US_FDA		1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1303495442924212224	
9.9.2020 0.48	JoeBiden		507	2480	12361	1: What criteria will be used to ensure a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety and efficacy? The FDA must clarify what criteria it will use, and President Trump must commit to respecting the independent judgment of the non-political professional staff at the FDA.				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1303495441875640321	
9.9.2020 0.48	JoeBiden		2695	10329	48333	A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine could save countless lives. We need one as soon as possible. But while I see a vaccine as a product of science, President Trump sees it as a political tool. Politics should play no role in this. The Administration must answer the following:				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1303495440701313025

8.9.2020 20.00	JoeBiden	bpolitics	2350	8459	34513	Just months ago, Donald Trump was planning to allow oil and gas drilling off the coast of Florida. Now, with 56 days until the election, he conveniently says that he changed his mind. Unbelievable.

8.9.2020 14.10	JoeBiden		6361	16170	84972	At our best, America has always been generous, kind, and optimistic. We treat each other with dignity, give hate no safe harbor, and leave no one behind.

8.9.2020 0.10	JoeBiden		5416	17243	55388	Mr. President — If you’re so good at making deals, then why does your trade deal cost American workers so much pain while letting China off the hook for its biggest trade abuses?				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1303123383840890880

7.9.2020 21.15	JoeBiden		8102	20026	103089	Wall Street didn't build this country — the middle class did. And unions built the middle class. Donald Trump doesn't understand that. We need a president who does.				1,30E+18	https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1303079343766331393
